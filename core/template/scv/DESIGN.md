# DESIGN — UI/UX spec

> **This document is only needed for projects with a user-facing UI (web/app).** CLI/backend-only projects mark `status: N/A` and skip it.
> the host agent follows `INTAKE.md` Step 3 plus the `How to elicit` section below to fill this through dialogue with the user.

## How to elicit (order of questions)

1. **Applicability**: "Does this have a UI? If not we'll skip this document." (If no, record `status: N/A`.)
2. **Personas**: "Who are the primary user personas? (1–3 people; goals, constraints, usage frequency.)"
3. **Core flows**: "What is the **most important journey** the personas perform here? (observable steps between a clear start and end.)"
4. **Screen list**: "Which screens does each flow pass through? (path, title, purpose.)"
5. **State machines**: "Are there **complex screens with multiple states**? What are the transitions between them?"
6. **Design tokens**: "Do you have color/spacing/typography tokens already? If not, will you define them in this project?"
7. **Accessibility**: "Are there accessibility standards? (WCAG level, keyboard-only, screen reader.)"
8. **Error / empty states**: "What's the UX principle for errors, permission denials, empty data?"

## Completion criteria

- [ ] Applicability decided (`status: active` or `N/A`)
- [ ] (if applicable) At least 1 persona

- [ ] (if applicable) At least 1 screen + each screen's purpose
- [ ] (if applicable) Design token source declared
- [ ] (if applicable) Accessibility standards agreed
- [ ] User confirms "this design is good to proceed with"
