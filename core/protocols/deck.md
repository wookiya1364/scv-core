# action:deck — markdown → 기획서 HTML

{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}

Turn a plain markdown doc into something that reads like a **real planning document
(기획서)** — headings become sections, GFM tables become data tables, ```mermaid
fences become diagrams, `> [!NOTE]`/`[!WARNING]` become callouts — and the **raw
markdown travels with the output** (the rendering and the source always agree).

**Two output shapes (same deterministic transform → they never diverge):**
- **Default — document.** A buildless, self-contained **single-HTML 기획서 document**
  you scroll top-to-bottom and print to PDF. No Vite/React/build; only a slim remark
  stack (~7MB), so it runs light. This is what most "마크다운만으론 이해가 안 된다" cases want.
- **`--slides` — presentation.** The DeckUI on-screen slide deck (Vite+React single-file
  build, heavier). Use when you want to present rather than read.

In the **document**, mermaid diagrams are baked in as inline SVG after the build — a
local headless Chrome draws them — so the file opens fully rendered with no network.
That bake is best-effort. When it can't run, the document keeps a CDN loader that
**auto-falls back to the diagram's source text** offline: never an empty box, but a
drawn diagram only where there is network. `--slides` bundles mermaid into the build
and needs neither.

**Division of labor (deterministic + LLM-assist):**
- The **transform is deterministic** (`scripts/deck.sh` → `DeckUI/scripts/deckdoc/transform.mjs`, remark-based). It never invents content: every rendered value comes from the source md.
- **You (the host agent)** assist around it: pick the input, surface the lint/gap report, and *offer* to improve the **source markdown** (never the generated output) when sections are missing — always with user approval.

## Language preference

Resolve the user's preferred language with this priority, then pass it to `deck.sh` as `--lang <LANG_RESOLVED>` in Step 1 — it selects the deck's UI chrome (buttons, headings, lint messages; never the user's own PLAN.md/TESTS.md/screen-mockup content, which always renders verbatim):

1. Project `.env` — `SCV_LANG` (set by `action:help`'s first-time setup).
2. Auto-detect from the user's most recent message language.
3. Default to English.

`LANG_RESOLVED` values: `english` (default) / `korean` / `japanese`; anything else falls back to English (same rule `deck.sh`/`doc.mjs` apply if `--lang` is omitted and `.env SCV_LANG` is unset).

## Plain language first

Say it the short way first. A reader who understands the short version can ask
for more; a reader lost in the long version asks for nothing.

- One idea per sentence. If a sentence needs a comma to join two clauses, it is
  usually two sentences.
- Use the plain name, not the category name. "the file that records decisions"
  lands faster than "the decision persistence layer".
- Lead with what happens to the user, then why it happens.
- A comparison to something ordinary is worth more than a precise description
  the reader cannot picture. Use one when it gets there faster.
- Define a term of art in the same breath you first use it, or drop the term.
- Detail is not owed up front. Offer it, and give it when asked.

This governs everything the user reads: questions, plans, progress reports,
summaries, and explanations of what went wrong.

## Step 0 — Resolve the input markdown

`{{SCV_ARGS}}` is a path to a markdown file, or to a `scv/promote|archive/<slug>/` folder — a folder combines PLAN + FEATURE_ARCHITECTURE + TESTS into one document, and is a document-only input (`--slides` takes a single file). If empty:
- Use `Glob` to find likely docs (`docs/**/*.md`, `**/PRD*.md`, `**/기획*.md`, or a `scv/promote/<slug>/PLAN.md`).
- If several, ask the user which one. If none, tell the user to pass a path: `action:deck docs/prd.md`.

Do **not** fabricate a doc. `action:deck` renders what exists.

## Step 0.5 — Compose a planner-grade structure (act like a 기획자)

A deck is only as good as its source. A real 기획서 does **not** just list features
— it opens with the **whole picture**, locates the change **inside** it, states the
**delta**, and explains **why**. A flat feature list produces the reaction "그래서
이게 어디에 붙는 건데?". Before building, make the source have this shape — pulling
context from the project's own docs, **never inventing** a system it can't see.

**Detect what exists (this drives the B→A flow):**

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/deck-context.sh" {{SCV_ARGS}}
```

Parse `BIG_PICTURE:` + `MODE_HINT:` (and the `DOCS_CONTEXT` / `GRAPHIFY_GRAPH` / `FEATURE_ARCH` source lines).

- **B — `BIG_PICTURE: absent`** → the deck can't show a whole that isn't documented, and you must not invent one. **Establish it first.** Offer by asking the user (default: build the graph): (1) **run `/graphify`** — builds the docs/code knowledge graph that gives the As-Is whole; (2) **run `action:promote <slug>`** — generates `FEATURE_ARCHITECTURE.md` (a "position in whole" diagram); (3) **proceed feature-only** with a lint warning that the big picture is missing (the minimum). Once it exists, continue to A.
- **A — `BIG_PICTURE: present`** → pull the sources below and compose the context-first structure.

**Big-picture sources (priority):**
1. `scv/promote/<slug>/FEATURE_ARCHITECTURE.md` — if this is a promote plan, it already has a "position in whole" diagram with `:::new` nodes.
2. The graphify docs graph (`.graphify/docs/`) + real architecture/screen docs under `docs/` — the existing system structure (the As-Is whole).
3. The feature's `PLAN.md` (problem, goals/non-goals, steps) — the delta + the why.

**Target section order** (compose into the source, or a `*-deck.md` working copy, with user approval):
1. **배경 / 왜 지금인가** — problem, impact, why-now (from PLAN / problem statement).
2. **전체 구조 (As-Is)** — a mermaid diagram of the existing system (from graphify / real project docs).
3. **이 기능의 위치 (To-Be)** — the same diagram with **new/changed nodes highlighted** (`classDef new/changed` + `:::new` / `:::changed`) so "이 부분이 바뀐다"가 한눈에 보인다.
4. **변경점 (As-Is → To-Be)** — a per-area table of what changes.
5. Details — 목표/비목표, 요구사항, 화면, 데이터, 성공지표, 예외처리.

**Faithfulness (non-negotiable):** the big picture must come from real docs. If no graphify graph / `FEATURE_ARCHITECTURE.md` / real architecture doc exists, do **not** invent a system diagram — tell the user the deck can't show the whole until one exists (offer to run `/graphify`, or `action:promote` which generates `FEATURE_ARCHITECTURE.md`), and proceed with what's available plus a lint warning. Ask for confirmation before rewriting the user's source.

## Step 1 — Build

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/deck.sh" {{SCV_ARGS}} --lang "<LANG_RESOLVED>"
```

This produces the **document** by default (`--doc` says so explicitly). If the user
asked for a slide presentation, append `--slides`. Other flags: `--mermaid none` (skip
the CDN script, always render mermaid as source text), `--no-source` (drop the
raw-markdown section), `--no-static` (skip the inline-SVG bake and ship the CDN loader
instead — `SCV_DECK_STATIC=0` in the environment does the same), `--out <path>`.

Parse the emitted lines:
- `DECK_SLUG:` — the deck id.
- `LINT: <n> warning(s)` + each `  ⚠ ...` — missing canonical sections.
- `DECK_HTML:` — absolute path to the built self-contained HTML.
- `STATIC_MERMAID: embedded diagrams=<n> → <path>` — the bake worked; that deck draws
  its diagrams offline. Document builds only, and only while mermaid is on.
- `STATIC_MERMAID: skipped (kept CDN render + text fallback)` — on **stderr**, with the
  reason on the line before it: no Chrome, the CDN unreachable, a diagram that failed
  to draw, or simply no diagrams in the doc. The HTML is left exactly as built.

If the helper errors (missing Node/pnpm), relay it and suggest `action:install-deps` (Node + pnpm are `action:deck`-only deps). The **document** path needs only a slim ~7MB install; `--slides` additionally builds the full DeckUI. Do not auto-install globally.

## Step 2 — Report + quality coaching

1. Tell the user it's built and **where**: `DECK_HTML`. One-line how-to-open (`open <path>` / double-click) and that it prints to PDF from the browser. The raw markdown travels with it in an always-on **side panel** (toggle button or the `S` key) — a slug-folder combine shows one tab per file (PLAN.md / FEATURE_ARCHITECTURE.md / TESTS.md). Printing swaps the panel for a plain paginated appendix.
2. When the bake was meant to run — a document build with mermaid on — and no
   `STATIC_MERMAID: embedded` line came back, **say so**. Silence here is how a deck
   ships depending on a CDN nobody noticed. Tell the user the diagrams load at view
   time, so a reader without network sees the diagram's source text instead, and pass
   on the reason. Missing browser → install Chrome/Chromium, or point `SCV_CHROME` at
   one, and re-run. A doc with no diagrams needs no fix. `--slides`, `--mermaid none`
   and `--no-static` opt out of the bake, so nothing is expected there.
3. If `LINT` > 0, surface the warnings plainly. These are the sections a professional 기획서 usually has but this doc lacks (비목표 / 성공지표 / 인수기준 / 예외처리, etc.).
4. **Offer** (by asking the user, default: just report) to help draft the missing sections **into the source markdown** — then the user re-runs `action:deck`. Never write invented specifics; propose structure + `<TODO>` placeholders and let the user fill real values.

## Never
- Never invent content that isn't in the source markdown (the rendering and the carried-along source must agree).
- Never edit generated output (the HTML, or the slide-path `deck.json`) by hand — edit the source md and re-run.
- Never modify files outside the deck flow without asking.
