# action:codegen

{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}

You — the host agent — drive a promote plan **TDD-first**: TESTS.md is the *input contract*, code is the *consequence*. Iterate Red → Green per case until all TESTS pass, then hand control to `action:work` for archive, PR, and regression.

> **Relationship with `action:work`** — `action:codegen` is the TDD-first variant of `action:work`. Steps 1–5b (context, PLAN/TESTS load, Playwright video setup) reuse `action:work`'s helper and protocol verbatim. The difference is Steps 6–8: instead of free implementation followed by tests, this command enforces *tests-fail-first* and *case-by-case minimal code*. After Step 8, Steps 9+ (report, regression, archive, supersede, PR, epic refactor) follow `action:work` verbatim.

## Language preference

Identical to `action:work`: resolve from project `.env` `SCV_LANG` →
auto-detect from the user's latest message → English. Technical identifiers
(skill invocation names, frontmatter keys, env var names, SCV terms like
`promote`/`archive`) stay as-is in every language.

## Plain language first

Say it the short way first. A reader who understands the short version can ask
for more; a reader lost in the long version asks for nothing.

- One idea per sentence. If a sentence needs a comma to join two clauses, it is
  usually two sentences.
- Use the plain name, not the category name. "the file that records decisions"
  lands faster than "the decision persistence layer".
- Lead with what happens to the user, then why it happens.
- A comparison to something ordinary is worth more than a precise description
  the reader cannot picture. Use one when it gets there faster.
- Define a term of art in the same breath you first use it, or drop the term.
- Detail is not owed up front. Offer it, and give it when asked.

This governs everything the user reads: questions, plans, progress reports,
summaries, and explanations of what went wrong.

## Non-negotiable rules

- **Never modify the body of TESTS.md** during codegen — the test is the spec. If TESTS appear under-specified, stop and ask the user to revise TESTS first; do not infer requirements from PLAN.md alone.
- **Never modify the body of an archived TESTS.md.** Obsolete marking is done only via 3 frontmatter fields on that archived folder's PLAN.md (`status: obsolete`, `obsoleted_at`, `obsoleted_by`).
- **The test file the plan's `## How to run` executes is part of the spec too** — including a per-slug E2E spec (e.g. `e2e/<slug>.spec.ts`). Never weaken, delete, or narrow its assertions to force a case Green; if it is genuinely wrong, stop and revise it via dialogue with the user (same rule as TESTS.md, even though the spec is editable code).
- Never delete or move files outside the scope of this plan.
- Never archive without explicit user approval (reached only via `action:work` Step 9b after Step 8 here).
- **Iteration budget: 3 attempts per failing case.** On exhaustion, stop and surface to the user — do not silently abandon a case.
- Refactor that touches files unrelated to a failing case is deferred to Step 8 (Refactor), never mixed into Green iteration.

First, gather context (same helper as `action:work`):

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/work.sh" {{SCV_ARGS}}
```

> **Monorepo (nested scv)** — same as `action:work`: an optional leading module dir targets its scv, e.g. `action:codegen FE <slug>` → `FE/scv`.

Parse the header (`MODE:`, `SCV_DIR:`, `TARGET_SLUG:`, `PLAN_FILE:`, `TESTS_FILE:`, `GRAPHIFY_SKILL:`, `GRAPH_STATUS:`) and the three content blocks (`=== active promote plans ===`, `=== related documents (from PLAN.md) ===`, `=== external refs (from PLAN.md frontmatter refs:) ===`) identically to `action:work` Step 0. In a monorepo, thread a non-`scv` `SCV_DIR` module target through Step 9 exactly as `action:work` does.

## Protocol

### Steps 1–5b — Identical to `action:work`

- **Step 1** — Select target (ask one concise question if the slug is ambiguous).
- **Step 2** — Graph freshness check.
- **Step 3** — Load PLAN.md. Summarize Summary / Goals / Steps in 3–5 bullets for scope confirmation. Surface external refs.
- **Step 4** — Load Related Documents as needed (token guard — don't read all by default).
- **Step 5** — Load TESTS.md. Extract `## How to run` and `## Pass criteria`.
- **Step 5b** — Playwright video auto-setup.

See `references/protocols/work.md` Steps 1–5b for full detail. This command follows that protocol verbatim — do not re-implement it here.

### Step 6 — Red pre-flight (TDD-first specific)

Before any code change, run TESTS in the current state to verify all relevant cases **fail**. This is the safety gate of TDD-first codegen.

Execute the run command(s) from TESTS.md's `## How to run` section via `Bash`. Capture output and evaluate against `## Pass criteria`.

Outcome handling:

| Current state | Action |
|---|---|
| **All cases fail** | Continue to Step 7. This is the expected Red state. |
| **All cases pass** | **Stop.** Either (a) code already exists for this plan — `action:work` is the right command, or (b) TESTS are under-specified (too loose to fail). Ask the user by asking the user which it is. |
| **Some cases pass, some fail** | **Pause and ask one question.** Options: [1] "Proceed — codegen only for failing cases (recommended)" / [2] "Revise TESTS first — some passing cases may be tautological" / [3] "Switch to `action:work` — partial code exists, free implementation more natural". |
| **TESTS syntax error or run command broken** | **Stop.** Report the error verbatim. Do not guess a fix — ask the user to repair TESTS first. |

#### Step 6.1 — TESTS quality smell check (v0.11.0+, automated)

After Red is confirmed, run the static smell helper (warn-only, never blocks):

```bash
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/tests-smell.sh" "$TESTS_FILE"
```

Parse the `TESTS_SMELL:` line:
- `clean` — proceed silently to Step 7.
- `warnings` — emit a single user-facing block summarizing the helper output (preserve the warning list verbatim), then proceed to Step 7. Do not block.

Example user-facing surface:

> ⚠ TESTS quality signals (heuristic): low assertion density (3 assertions across 3 scenarios — recommend 2+ per scenario). Proceeding — codegen may need extra cases revisited later.

The helper is a static heuristic — grep-level checks on scenario headings, assertion keywords, and `typeof` concentration. False positives are possible (e.g., small focused plans). Active mutation probe (actually mutate code and verify TESTS catch it) is a separate future iteration.

### Step 7 — Green iteration (per failing case)

Walk failing cases in the order the test runner reports them. For each case:

1. **Pick one failing case.** Identify the TESTS scenario / case (e.g., `E2E-001`, `unit:refundCalc:negative`) and the error message.
2. **Describe to the user (one sentence)**: "Now writing minimal code to pass `<case>`."
3. **Update PLAN.md frontmatter**: `status: planned` → `status: in_progress` on the first iteration of this run.
4. **Implement the minimum** using `Read` / `Edit` / `Write`:
   - Follow PLAN.md's `Steps` order.
   - **Scope guard**: if PLAN.md frontmatter has `scope:` (glob array, v0.11.0+ — see `scv/PROMOTE.md` §4), Edit/Write outside those globs emits a warning *"out-of-scope path: <path> (not in PLAN.md scope: <globs>) — continue? (default no)"* by asking the user. Does not auto-block. If `scope:` is omitted, fall back to natural scope from PLAN.md Steps (current `action:work` behavior).
   - Avoid speculative refactor — that belongs to Step 8.
   - Apply the **Implementation principles** from `action:work` Step 6 — reuse what is there before building, simplest implementation that satisfies the requirement, one clear concern per component, and long-term choices where they are costly to reverse. PLAN.md `Guardrails` override them. TDD's minimal-code rule already covers the second; the other three still apply here, because reuse and boundaries get decided while writing the code, not in Step 8's refactor.
5. **Re-run TESTS** (full suite when fast; use the test runner's `--grep` / case-filter if the suite is slow and the case has a stable identifier):
   - Picked case now passes + no regression on previously passing cases → **invariants self-check** (next sub-step) → next case.
   - Picked case still fails → record attempt count. Retry up to **3 attempts total per case**.
   - Any previously passing case now fails → **rollback the last change** (revert via `Edit`), then retry with a smaller diff.
5a. **Invariants self-check** (if PLAN.md frontmatter has `invariants:`, v0.11.0+): re-read each invariant string and verify the iteration's diff does not violate any of them. This is an LLM self-audit — TESTS may not catch T5 logic-skip (silently omitting an unrelated invariant). If a violation is suspected, **rollback the change** and try a different approach. If unsure, surface by asking the user: "Diff appears to violate invariant `<X>` — rollback / proceed anyway / let me review?" Skip this sub-step if `invariants:` is empty or absent.
6. **Iteration budget exhausted (3 attempts)** → stop. Report to the user:
   - "Could not pass `<case>` after 3 attempts. Last error: `<message>`. Last diff: `<short summary>`."
   - Ask one concise question with options:
     - [1] "Take over — pause codegen, I'll continue with `action:work`"
     - [2] "Revise TESTS — the case may be unreachable as written"
     - [3] "Skip this case and continue with the rest — PLAN will NOT be archived"

After all failing cases pass (or are explicitly skipped via option [3]):
- Update PLAN.md frontmatter `status: in_progress` → `status: testing`.

### Step 8 — Refactor (optional, post-Green)

With all (non-skipped) TESTS passing, optionally clean up:

1. Summarize the diff so far in one line: file count, line count, primary files touched.
2. Ask once (default **No** — keep diff small):
   - "All TESTS pass. Refactor the code now (rename, extract, dedupe)?"
3. If user picks Yes:
   - Make refactor changes within the same plan scope. Never expand scope here.
   - Re-run TESTS after each significant change.
   - If any TEST fails after a refactor change, **rollback that change immediately**. Report which change broke it.
4. If user picks No, proceed to Step 9.

### Step 9+ — Hand off to `action:work`

After Step 8, the work cycle (report → regression pre-flight → archive decision → supersede propagation → PR creation → epic refactor notice) is identical to `action:work` Steps 8–9e. Follow `protocols/work.md` verbatim from that point.

Hand-off map:

| `action:codegen` step | `action:work` step | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Step 9 | Step 8 | Report results to user |
| Step 10 | Step 9a | Regression pre-flight (optional user question) |
| Step 11 | Step 9b | Archive decision (user approval required) |
| Step 12 | Step 9c | Supersede propagation (one user confirmation per slug) |
| Step 13 | Step 9d | PR auto-creation (with e2e video) |
| Step 14 | Step 9e | Epic completion refactor notice |

## Flag semantics

- `<slug>` — same as `action:work`: required for actual work; optional to just list plans. Partial match supported (helper fuzzy-resolves suffixes).

## When to use `action:codegen` vs `action:work`

| Situation | Command |
|---|---|
| TESTS.md is the spec, code does not yet exist | `action:codegen <slug>` |
| Code partially exists or PLAN.md is exploratory | `action:work <slug>` |
| Refactor of existing code (TESTS already pass) | `action:work <slug>` |
| You want free LLM implementation following PLAN.md `Steps` | `action:work <slug>` |
| You want the test to drive the code, case by case | `action:codegen <slug>` |

Backend domain logic, pure functions, and frontend custom hook (`.ts`) logic typically have well-shaped TESTS for `action:codegen`. Frontend rendering / UI integration is usually better served by `action:work` with e2e TESTS.

## Never

- Modify TESTS.md body to make a failing case pass. The test is the spec — revise it only via dialogue with the user.
- Weaken / delete / narrow assertions in the test the plan's `## How to run` runs (e.g. a per-slug `e2e/<slug>.spec.ts`) to make a case pass — it is a test contract; revise it only via dialogue.
- Touch files outside the plan's scope.
- Skip Step 6 (Red pre-flight).
- Exceed the iteration budget (3 per case) without surfacing to the user.
- Archive without going through `action:work` Step 9b's user approval.
- Re-implement `action:work` Steps 1–5b or 9+ in this file — always link to `protocols/work.md`.
