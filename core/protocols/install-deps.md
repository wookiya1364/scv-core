# action:install-deps

Detect SCV's external CLI dependencies on the current machine and help the user install whatever is missing.

## Language preference

Resolve the user's preferred language with this priority, then use it for ALL user-facing output (question text, summaries):

1. Project `.env` — `SCV_LANG` (set by `action:help`'s first-time setup).
2. Auto-detect from the user's most recent message language.
3. Default to English.

Technical identifiers (tool names like `gh`, `glab`, `ffmpeg`, command names, file paths, env var names) stay as-is. If `.env` `SCV_LANG` is unset, suggest `action:help` once to lock the preference (don't block — fall back to auto-detect / English for now).

## Plain language first

Skip this section only when the project `.env` sets `SCV_PLAIN_LANGUAGE=off`
(absent or any other value = on).

Answer shape — every time you explain something to the user:

1. First, 1–2 sentences. Lead with what the user gets.
2. Then one example — from the user's situation, or an everyday comparison.
3. No code values before the user asks: file paths, variable names, version
   numbers, setting values. Use the plain name instead ("the settings file",
   "last week's plan").
4. Detail comes after, and only when wanted. Offer it in one line.

Identifiers the user needs to act on — the next command to run, a file that
was created — stay exact, after the plain summary.

Bad: "The block landed in `.env.example.scv:154-161` and the stamp advanced
2.1.0 → 2.2.0."
Good: "Your settings example file is up to date. For example, the new 'effort'
setting now shows there. Want the exact lines?"

This governs everything the user reads: answers, questions, plans, progress
reports, summaries, and explanations of what went wrong.

## Step 0 — Run --check

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/install-deps.sh" --check
```

Parse the output:
- `OS detected:` and `Package manager:` lines tell you the user's environment.
- `Dependency check:` block shows each tool with `[✓]` (installed), `[✗]` (missing — required/recommended tier), or `[△]` (missing — optional tier, graceful degrade).
- The `Result:` line at the end is one of:
  - `All deps installed.` — exit 0, nothing to do.
  - `All required tools installed. Some recommended/optional missing — ...` — exit 0, partial.
  - `REQUIRED tools missing: ...` — exit 1.

## Step 1 — Decide what to do

If the `Result:` line says **`All deps installed`** AND graphify is present:
- Tell the user "All SCV dependencies are installed." in their preferred language.
- Stop.

Otherwise, ask the user one concise question to decide next action:

```
Question: "<n> dependencies are missing. What would you like to do?"
  (where <n> is the missing count from --check output)

Options:
[1] "Install now"
    description:
    "Run `install-deps.sh --install` to actually install the missing system tools.
     - Linux / macOS: sudo password may be prompted for apt / dnf / pacman.
     - Windows: winget will open its own confirmation dialog per package.
     - graphify (the host agent skill) is NOT installed by this command — it has a
       different distribution channel. See https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify
       and place SKILL.md in the skill directory configured by your wrapper."

[2] "Just print the install commands (I'll run them myself)"
    description:
    "No installation is performed. The output of --check already shows the
     exact commands for the detected OS / package manager — copy and run them
     in your terminal as you see fit. Use this if you prefer reviewing each
     step or you don't want sudo to be invoked from a skill invocation."

[3] "Cancel — do nothing for now"
    description:
    "Exit without changes. SCV will keep running in graceful-degrade mode for
     missing optional tools (ffmpeg / python3). For missing required tools
     (git) or platform tools (gh / glab) the related skill invocations may fail
     until installed."
```

Answer handling:

- **[1] Install now**:
  ```!
  "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/install-deps.sh" --install
  ```
  After it returns, summarize the result in the user's language: how many tools installed, any failures, whether `--check` should be re-run for verification (you can offer to do so but don't auto-run).

- **[2] Print only**: Tell the user the commands are already shown in Step 0's output, and remind them which OS-specific block applies. No further script invocation.

- **[3] Cancel**: One-line confirmation. Stop.

## Notes

- **graphify is NOT auto-installed.** It is a the host agent skill (not a system CLI) with a different distribution channel. The script's output and Step 1's description always link to https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify so the user can install it manually.
- **Idempotency**: `--check` and `--install` are safe to re-run. `--install` skips already-installed tools.
- **Verification scope**: install commands are documented per upstream packaging guides. The repository author has end-to-end-verified Linux/apt only. macOS / Windows / other Linux distros are best-effort — if a command needs adjustment, open an issue on the SCV repo.

## Never

- Auto-run `--install` without an explicit confirmation. The user must choose `[1] Install now`.
- Modify the user's wrapper skill directory or attempt to download graphify automatically.
- Suggest `sudo` commands for Windows (winget runs as user; admin elevation is per-package via the system dialog).
