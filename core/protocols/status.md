# action:status

{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}

Inspects the project's SCV state:

- **Raw changes**: files under `scv/raw/` added / modified / removed since `scv/readpath.json` was last updated.
- **Raw lifecycle**: **unused** docs (still directly under `scv/raw/` — never consumed by any promote) vs **consumed** docs (moved to `scv/raw/stale/` by `action:promote`, shown with the promote slugs that used them from `readpath.json`'s `ref_docs`).
- **Outdated candidates**: consumed docs that mention repo files changed since their `ref_commit` — their content may have drifted from the code. This is a heuristic flag; when the user wants to reuse such a doc, offer to verify its claims against the current code first.
- **Active promote plans**: entries under `scv/promote/` waiting for implementation.
- **Docs graph**: graphify skill presence + docs graph freshness (`missing` / `built` / `stale` / skill-not-installed).
- **Archive**: count of completed plans under `scv/archive/`.
- **Recent decisions** (v0.22.0+): the last N entries of the append-only `scv/DECISIONS.md` (author-attributed — written by promote approval, work archive, and regression obsolete triage).
- **Open TODOs** (v0.22.0+): unchecked `scv/TODO.md` items, counted per author (`@<author>`), listed with their `(T-NNN)` ids.
- **Workspace** (multi-repo / monorepo only; silent for single repos): for a CHILD, the incoming handoffs addressed to this repo; for the ROOT umbrella, a coordination view grouping handoffs by target repo and status.

## Language preference

Resolve the user's preferred language with this priority, then use it for ALL user-facing output (section headings, descriptions, summaries):

1. Project `.env` — `SCV_LANG` (set by `action:help`'s first-time setup).
2. Auto-detect from the user's most recent message language.
3. Default to English.

Technical identifiers stay as-is: file paths, skill invocation names, env var names, SCV terms (`raw`, `promote`, `archive`, `orphan branch`).

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/status.sh" {{SCV_ARGS}}
```

## Plain language first

Skip this section only when the project `.env` sets `SCV_PLAIN_LANGUAGE=off`
(absent or any other value = on).

Answer shape — every time you explain something to the user:

1. First, 1–2 sentences. Lead with what the user gets.
2. Then one example — from the user's situation, or an everyday comparison.
3. No code values before the user asks: file paths, variable names, version
   numbers, setting values. Use the plain name instead ("the settings file",
   "last week's plan").
4. Detail comes after, and only when wanted. Offer it in one line.

Identifiers the user needs to act on — the next command to run, a file that
was created — stay exact, after the plain summary.

Bad: "The block landed in `.env.example.scv:154-161` and the stamp advanced
2.1.0 → 2.2.0."
Good: "Your settings example file is up to date. For example, the new 'effort'
setting now shows there. Want the exact lines?"

This governs everything the user reads: answers, questions, plans, progress
reports, summaries, and explanations of what went wrong.

## Flags

- `--ack` — After showing changes, overwrite `scv/readpath.json` with the current state. Use this when you've reviewed the changes but are deferring `action:promote`.
- `--verbose` — Show every changed path (default collapses to 10 per bucket).

## Monorepo (nested scv)

SCV resolves which `scv/` to use from context: `./scv`, else the nearest parent `scv/`. In a monorepo with a per-module scv (e.g. `FE/scv`, `BE/scv`) plus a root umbrella `scv/`, either run from the module dir, or name the module as the first argument:

- `action:status FE` — status for `FE/scv` (micro)
- `action:status` from the repo root — status for the root umbrella `scv/` (macro)

## Typical flow

1. Team drops new raw materials into `scv/raw/`.
2. Run `action:status` to see what changed and what's pending.
3. Either:
   - Run `action:promote` to refine into promote plans (recommended — will also update the index), OR
   - Run `action:status --ack` to mark current state as baseline and defer.

## Legacy backfill (projects older than the stale/ lifecycle)

Projects promoted before the `scv/raw/stale/` lifecycle existed will list every
historical raw doc as **unused**, even ones that old promote folders already
consumed. If the unused list contains paths that appear in `raw_sources:` of
PLAN.md files under `scv/promote/` or `scv/archive/`, offer a one-time backfill:
for each such plan, run

```
!${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/readpath.sh consume <plan-slug> <raw path>...
```

and update that PLAN.md's `raw_sources` paths to the reported `MOVED` locations.
Only do this with the user's approval — it moves files (content unchanged).
