# action:status

{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}

Inspects the project's SCV state:

- **Raw changes**: files under `scv/raw/` added / modified / removed since `scv/readpath.json` was last updated.
- **Raw lifecycle**: **unused** docs (still directly under `scv/raw/` — never consumed by any promote) vs **consumed** docs (moved to `scv/raw/stale/` by `action:promote`, shown with the promote slugs that used them from `readpath.json`'s `ref_docs`).
- **Outdated candidates**: consumed docs that mention repo files changed since their `ref_commit` — their content may have drifted from the code. This is a heuristic flag; when the user wants to reuse such a doc, offer to verify its claims against the current code first.
- **Active promote plans**: entries under `scv/promote/` waiting for implementation.
- **Docs graph**: graphify skill presence + docs graph freshness (`missing` / `built` / `stale` / skill-not-installed).
- **Archive**: count of completed plans under `scv/archive/`.
- **Recent decisions** (v0.22.0+): the last N entries of the append-only `scv/DECISIONS.md` (author-attributed — written by promote approval, work archive, and regression obsolete triage).
- **Open TODOs** (v0.22.0+): unchecked `scv/TODO.md` items, counted per author (`@<author>`), listed with their `(T-NNN)` ids.
- **Workspace** (multi-repo / monorepo only; silent for single repos): for a CHILD, the incoming handoffs addressed to this repo; for the ROOT umbrella, a coordination view grouping handoffs by target repo and status.

## Language preference

Resolve the user's preferred language with this priority, then use it for ALL user-facing output (section headings, descriptions, summaries):

1. Project `.env` — `SCV_LANG` (set by `action:help`'s first-time setup).
2. Auto-detect from the user's most recent message language.
3. Default to English.

Technical identifiers stay as-is: file paths, skill invocation names, env var names, SCV terms (`raw`, `promote`, `archive`, `orphan branch`).

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/status.sh" {{SCV_ARGS}}
```

## Flags

- `--ack` — After showing changes, overwrite `scv/readpath.json` with the current state. Use this when you've reviewed the changes but are deferring `action:promote`.
- `--verbose` — Show every changed path (default collapses to 10 per bucket).

## Monorepo (nested scv)

SCV resolves which `scv/` to use from context: `./scv`, else the nearest parent `scv/`. In a monorepo with a per-module scv (e.g. `FE/scv`, `BE/scv`) plus a root umbrella `scv/`, either run from the module dir, or name the module as the first argument:

- `action:status FE` — status for `FE/scv` (micro)
- `action:status` from the repo root — status for the root umbrella `scv/` (macro)

## Typical flow

1. Team drops new raw materials into `scv/raw/`.
2. Run `action:status` to see what changed and what's pending.
3. Either:
   - Run `action:promote` to refine into promote plans (recommended — will also update the index), OR
   - Run `action:status --ack` to mark current state as baseline and defer.

## Legacy backfill (projects older than the stale/ lifecycle)

Projects promoted before the `scv/raw/stale/` lifecycle existed will list every
historical raw doc as **unused**, even ones that old promote folders already
consumed. If the unused list contains paths that appear in `raw_sources:` of
PLAN.md files under `scv/promote/` or `scv/archive/`, offer a one-time backfill:
for each such plan, run

```
!${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/readpath.sh consume <plan-slug> <raw path>...
```

and update that PLAN.md's `raw_sources` paths to the reported `MOVED` locations.
Only do this with the user's approval — it moves files (content unchanged).
