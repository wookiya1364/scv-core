# action:status

{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}

Inspects the project's SCV state:

- **Raw changes**: files under `scv/raw/` added / modified / removed since `scv/readpath.json` was last updated.
- **Active promote plans**: entries under `scv/promote/` waiting for implementation.
- **Docs graph**: graphify skill presence + docs graph freshness (`missing` / `built` / `stale` / skill-not-installed).
- **Archive**: count of completed plans under `scv/archive/`.
- **Workspace** (multi-repo / monorepo only; silent for single repos): for a CHILD, the incoming handoffs addressed to this repo; for the ROOT umbrella, a coordination view grouping handoffs by target repo and status.

## Language preference

Resolve the user's preferred language with this priority, then use it for ALL user-facing output (section headings, descriptions, summaries):

1. Project `.env` — `SCV_LANG` (set by `action:help`'s first-time setup).
2. Auto-detect from the user's most recent message language.
3. Default to English.

Technical identifiers stay as-is: file paths, skill invocation names, env var names, SCV terms (`raw`, `promote`, `archive`, `orphan branch`).

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/status.sh" {{SCV_ARGS}}
```

## Flags

- `--ack` — After showing changes, overwrite `scv/readpath.json` with the current state. Use this when you've reviewed the changes but are deferring `action:promote`.
- `--verbose` — Show every changed path (default collapses to 10 per bucket).

## Monorepo (nested scv)

SCV resolves which `scv/` to use from context: `./scv`, else the nearest parent `scv/`. In a monorepo with a per-module scv (e.g. `FE/scv`, `BE/scv`) plus a root umbrella `scv/`, either run from the module dir, or name the module as the first argument:

- `action:status FE` — status for `FE/scv` (micro)
- `action:status` from the repo root — status for the root umbrella `scv/` (macro)

## Typical flow

1. Team drops new raw materials into `scv/raw/`.
2. Run `action:status` to see what changed and what's pending.
3. Either:
   - Run `action:promote` to refine into promote plans (recommended — will also update the index), OR
   - Run `action:status --ack` to mark current state as baseline and defer.
