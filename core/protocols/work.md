# action:work

{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}

You — the host agent — drive a promote plan to completion: **read PLAN.md + TESTS.md → implement → run tests → archive on success**. Full protocol in `scv/PROMOTE.md`.

## Language preference

Resolve the user's preferred language with this priority, then use it for ALL user-facing output (question text, status messages, summaries, the non-Playwright notice in Step 5b, etc.):

1. Project `.env` — `SCV_LANG` (set by `action:help`'s first-time setup).
2. Auto-detect from the user's most recent message language.
3. Default to English.

Technical identifiers stay as-is in every language: file paths, skill invocation names (`action:work`), frontmatter keys (`status`, `kind`, `epic`, `supersedes`), env var names (`SCV_LANG`, `SCV_ATTACHMENTS_*`), and SCV terms (`promote`, `archive`, `orphan branch`, `epic`).

If `.env` `SCV_LANG` is unset, you may suggest the user run `action:help` once to lock the preference (don't block the current task on it — fall back to auto-detect / English for now).

**Non-negotiable rules:**
- Never delete or move files outside the scope of this plan.
- Never archive without either (a) tests passing AND user approval in this conversation, or (b) the user's earlier declarative pre-approval (e.g., "auto-archive when tests pass" / "tests 통과하면 알아서 archive 해").
- When implementing, respect the user's document-split guidance (see Step 3 below).
- Always run the tests — do not declare "done" based on reasoning alone.
- **Never modify the body of an archived TESTS.md.** Obsolete marking is done only via 3 frontmatter fields on that archived folder's PLAN.md (`status: obsolete`, `obsoleted_at`, `obsoleted_by`).
- **Never auto-mark on supersede propagation** — always ask the Step 9c confirmation (default Yes).

First, gather context:

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/work.sh" {{SCV_ARGS}}
```

> **Monorepo (nested scv)** — pass a module dir as the first argument to target its scv: `action:work FE <slug>` operates on `FE/scv`. Omit it to use the current dir's `scv/` (or nearest parent).

Parse the header (`MODE:`, `SCV_DIR:`, `TARGET_SLUG:`, `PLAN_FILE:`, `TESTS_FILE:`, `GRAPHIFY_SKILL:`, `GRAPH_STATUS:`) and the three content blocks (`=== active promote plans ===`, `=== related documents (from PLAN.md) ===`, `=== external refs (from PLAN.md frontmatter refs:) ===`).

> **Monorepo module threading** — if `SCV_DIR:` is **not** plain `scv` (i.e. the user targeted a nested module, e.g. `action:work FE <slug>` → `SCV_DIR: FE/scv`), pass that `SCV_DIR` value as the **leading arg** to every lifecycle helper in Step 9 — `regression.sh <SCV_DIR>`, `work.sh <SCV_DIR> <slug> --archive`, `pr-helper.sh <SCV_DIR> <slug>` — so Steps 9a/9b/9d all operate on the SAME scv/. Omitting it makes the Step-9a regression gate run against the wrong scv and pass **without testing (false green)**. For a plain `scv` (standalone/root), pass nothing extra.

## Protocol

> **Dependency note** — If the helper emits warnings about missing external CLI
> (`gh` / `glab` / `ffmpeg` / etc.) or missing `graphify` skill, suggest running
> `action:install-deps` once to get OS-specific install commands. Don't auto-run
> it. graphify install: https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify

### Step 0 — Archive short-circuit

If `MODE: archive`: the helper already moved the folder and wrote `ARCHIVED_AT.md`. Just report the `ARCHIVED:` line and stop. Do not continue with Steps 1+.

### Step 1 — Select target

- If `TARGET_SLUG: (none …)` → ask the user which plan from the list to work on. Re-invoke the helper with the chosen slug.
- If ambiguous (helper exit 2): show the matches, ask user to pick one by asking the user.

### Step 2 — Graph freshness check

Based on `GRAPHIFY_SKILL` + `GRAPH_STATUS`:

| GRAPHIFY_SKILL | GRAPH_STATUS | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `available` | `stale` | Ask the user: "docs graph is stale — refresh it first via `action:promote --graph-only`?" Default: **yes**. If yes, tell user the command (do NOT invoke `action:promote` yourself from here — they run it). If no, continue. |
| `available` | `missing` or `built` | Continue. |
| `missing` (skill) | any | Continue. Mention once (one line): "graphify skill not installed — see https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify or run `action:install-deps` for the full deps list." Don't repeat on subsequent runs. |

### Step 3 — Load PLAN.md (required)

`Read` the `PLAN_FILE` path emitted by the helper. Summarize `Summary`, `Goals / Non-Goals`, `Guardrails` + `Exit criteria` (when present), and `Suggested path` (legacy PLANs: `Steps`) to the user in 3–5 bullets so they can confirm scope. Both PLAN forms are valid — a legacy PLAN with only `## Steps` and no Guardrails / Exit criteria is processed exactly as before.

Also surface any **external refs** from the helper's `=== external refs ===` block (grouped by `type`, e.g. `[jira] 2`, `[pr] 1`). One line per type is enough — the user can follow links without the host agent reading them.

**Document split judgment** (applied from now on, through implementation):

| Signal | the host agent's action |
|---|---|
| User explicit: "split it" / "split into ARCH.md" / "extract into REQUIREMENTS.md" (or any-language equivalent like 분리해 / REQUIREMENTS.md 로 빼줘) | **Always split** — write the new file and trim PLAN.md accordingly. Ask before the actual write. |
| User explicit: "don't split" / "keep it in one file" / "no split" (or 분리 마) | **Do not propose split**. Continue in PLAN.md even if it grows. |
| Neither (default) | the host agent judges. If `Approach Overview` > ~50 lines, `Suggested path` (or legacy `Steps`) > ~15, or implementation reveals a dense sub-topic (ARCH / REQUIREMENTS / API / MIGRATION / tests) — **propose** split by asking the user. User accepts or declines. |

### Step 4 — Load Related Documents (as needed)

Look at the helper's `=== related documents (from PLAN.md) ===` list.

- If empty → skip.
- If listed: **don't read them all by default** (token guard).
- Read individual entries only when:
  1. The user explicitly requests (e.g., "also read ARCH.md when implementing" / "ARCH.md 도 보고 구현해"), **or**
  2. the host agent judges the content of the current step needs that context (e.g., Step says "per API.md contract" — then Read API.md).
- Any file marked `(MISSING)` by the helper → note it in summary; ask user if they want it created.

### Step 5 — Load TESTS.md (required)

`Read` the `TESTS_FILE`. Extract:
- The `## How to run` (or legacy `## 실행 방법`) section — actual test command(s).
- The `## Pass criteria` (or legacy `## 통과 판정`) section — pass/fail rules.

If TESTS.md is missing or the run section is empty / ambiguous → **stop and ask**. Do not guess a test command.

#### Step 5b — Playwright video auto-setup (SCV's standard E2E framework, v0.3+)

After loading TESTS.md, decide whether to set up E2E video recording. **SCV's standard E2E framework is Playwright** — automatic detection, auto video config, and PR auto-attach are guaranteed only for Playwright.

1. Use `Glob` to look for `playwright.config.{ts,js,mjs,cjs}` at project root.
2. **If `playwright.config.*` found**: continue with the Playwright video config flow below.
3. **If `playwright.config.*` not found, but other E2E indicators are present** (any of: `cypress.config.{ts,js,mjs}` exists, or `package.json`'s `dependencies` / `devDependencies` contains `cypress` or `puppeteer`): emit the **non-Playwright notice** (see end of this step) **once**, then proceed to Step 6 without modifying any config.
4. **If neither**: skip this step entirely (non-E2E project — proceed to Step 6).

##### Playwright video config flow (only when `playwright.config.*` found)

`Read` the config file and check for `video:` configuration inside the `use:` block.

If `video:` is **missing** or set to `'off'`:

   ```
   Ask once (default Yes):
     Question: "Playwright video recording is off. Should SCV turn it on automatically?"
     options:
     [1] "Yes — auto-add video: 'on' (recommended)"
         description:
         "Adds a single `video: 'on'` line into the `use:` block of playwright.config.
          From then on, every Playwright test produces .webm under test-results/, and
          action:work Step 9d's PR creation auto-embeds those videos into the PR body
          (via the scv-attachments orphan branch — zero impact on the working branch's
          git history).

          Videos are auto-deleted N days after PR merge (default 3, configurable)."

     [2] "No — proceed without video"
         description:
         "Leaves playwright.config alone. Only screenshots will be attached to the PR."
   ```

If user picks **[1] Yes**: use `Edit` to insert `video: 'on'` into the `use:` block.
   - If `use:` block exists: insert `video: 'on'` line.
   - If no `use:` block: add `use: { video: 'on' },` at top-level config object.
   - Confirm the edit is consistent with file's TypeScript/JavaScript syntax.

If user picks **[2] No**: continue without modifying config.

If `video:` is already `'on'`: skip silently (already records every run — nothing to do).

If `video:` is `'retain-on-failure'` or `'retry-with-video'`: these record **nothing on a passing run**, so a **green** feature PR would have no video. Surface it by asking the user (default Yes):

   ```
   Question: "Playwright video is set to `<mode>`, which records nothing on a passing run — so feature PRs won't get a video. Switch to video: 'on'?"
   options:
   [1] "Yes — switch to video: 'on' (recommended for feature-visible PRs)"
   [2] "No — keep `<mode>` (green PRs stay videoless)"
   ```

   On **Yes**, `Edit` the mode to `'on'`. On **No**, leave the config untouched.

This flow runs **once per project** in practice — after the config is `'on'` (or the user declines), it stays put.

##### Non-Playwright notice (Cypress / Puppeteer / others)

When emitted, print this as a single info block (not a question — work proceeds normally):

> ⚠ **SCV's standard E2E framework is Playwright.**
>
> This project shows signs of Cypress / Puppeteer / another tool. SCV guarantees automatic detection, auto video config, and PR auto-attach only for Playwright. Other tools still get PR attachment if their `.webm` / `.mp4` outputs land in `test-results/`, but auto video config (Step 5b) does not apply.
>
> Recommended migration to Playwright:
> - Cypress → Playwright: https://playwright.dev/docs/migrating-from-cypress
> - Puppeteer → Playwright: https://playwright.dev/docs/puppeteer
>
> (SCV work continues as normal — this is a notice only.)

### Step 5c — Long-run execution contract (v0.22.0+)

Once you hold PLAN.md's **Guardrails / Exit criteria** and TESTS.md's **verification means** (the `## How to run` commands), do not wait for — or ask for — step-by-step procedural instructions: **run to completion**. The Suggested path is a suggestion; Guardrails and Exit criteria are the contract. Work autonomously until the Exit criteria are met and TESTS pass, checking back with the user only at the decision points this protocol defines (split proposals, archive, PR). When you get stuck, **strengthen the verification means first** — add a failing repro, tighten an assertion, improve observability — instead of asking the user to micro-specify the procedure. Legacy PLANs that have only `## Steps` are still fully valid: treat `## Steps` as the Suggested path and TESTS.md's `## Pass criteria` as the Exit criteria.

Relation to Ralph Loop: this paragraph is what owns `action:work`'s long-run behavior — no external loop harness is required for a plan to run to completion (an external loop remains an optional accelerant, not a dependency).

### Step 5d — Parallel fan-out hint (`parallel_groups`, optional, v0.22.0+)

If PLAN.md frontmatter declares `parallel_groups:` (e.g. `parallel_groups: [[1, 2], [3]]` — inner arrays of Suggested-path step numbers that are independent of each other), and your host supports subagents / parallel workflows, you MAY fan out: run the steps of each group concurrently (groups themselves run in declaration order), then verify each TESTS scenario independently before merging results. The hint never changes WHAT must hold — Guardrails / Exit criteria / TESTS remain the contract for every parallel branch. If the field is absent, or the host has no parallel capability, behave exactly as before (sequential execution — zero behavior change).

### Step 6 — Implement

Follow `PLAN.md`'s `Suggested path` (legacy PLANs: `Steps`) as the default route — it is a suggestion, not the contract; if you find a better path that satisfies the Guardrails and Exit criteria, take it and tell the user in one line. For each step:
1. Describe the change to the user briefly (one sentence).
2. Use `Read` / `Edit` / `Write` as needed.
3. After each significant change, surface any document-split proposal per Step 3.

Update `PLAN.md` frontmatter `status:` as you progress:
- `planned` → `in_progress` when you start implementation
- `in_progress` → `testing` when code is complete and you're about to run TESTS

### Step 7 — Run TESTS

Execute the command(s) from the TESTS.md run section via the `Bash` tool. Capture output. Evaluate against pass criteria.

- All scenarios pass + criteria met → proceed to Step 8.
- Any scenario fails → loop back to Step 6 to fix. **Do not archive.** Set frontmatter `status:` back to `in_progress`.

### Step 8 — Report results to the user

Summarize:
- Implementation: what changed (files, key decisions).
- Test results: each scenario pass/fail + overall verdict.
- Plan's `status:` now `testing` (or back to `in_progress` if failures).

### Step 9a — Regression pre-flight (optional)

Condition: All TESTS passed in Step 7 and not in pre-declared archive mode.

Ask: "Run accumulated regression (entire `scv/archive/`) before archiving? Slugs declared in PLAN's `supersedes:` are auto-skipped."

Options:
- **Yes, run `action:regression` now** (default) — invoke the command immediately
- **Skip — just archive** — go straight to Step 9b
- **Let me review first** — pause (stop the command flow)

If Yes:

```
bash ${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/regression.sh [<SCV_DIR>] --quiet
```

Result handling:
- `FAILED_SLUGS: 0` → one-line "regression green" report, then Step 9b.
- `FAILED_SLUGS: >0` → report failure count + slug list to the user first, then **re-ask whether to proceed to Step 9b**:
  - "Regression failed. Halt archive and triage with `action:regression` first" (recommended)
  - "Ignore failures and archive" (risky — only if user explicitly approves)
  - "Hold off on archiving for now"

**Pre-declared mode** (e.g., user said earlier "auto-archive when tests pass" / "tests 통과하면 알아서 archive 해"): pre-flight still runs automatically, but if `FAILED_SLUGS: 0` it proceeds to Step 9b without asking.

### Step 9b — Archive decision

Only if tests fully passed in Step 7 (and Step 9a passed or was skipped):

| User posture | Action |
|---|---|
| Pre-declared (e.g., "auto-archive when tests pass" / "tests 통과하면 알아서 archive 해", spoken earlier in this conversation) | Auto-invoke: `bash ${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/work.sh [<SCV_DIR>] <slug> --archive --reason="tests passed"`. Report the ARCHIVED: line. |
| No pre-declaration | Ask: "All tests passed. Archive `<slug>` now?" with options: **Archive now** / **Keep in promote** / **Let me review first**. Proceed per answer. |
| User says no (keep in promote) | Update PLAN.md frontmatter `status: done` but leave the folder in `scv/promote/`. |

After a successful archive, remind the user:
- `scv/archive/<slug>/ARCHIVED_AT.md` has the archive record.
- Future `action:status` will no longer flag this plan.

**Refresh the 기획서 deck** — implementation may have edited PLAN.md / TESTS.md, so regenerate the archived plan's human-readable deck from the final docs:

```
!${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/deck.sh "scv/archive/<slug>" --lang "<PLAN_LANG>"
```

Read `<PLAN_LANG>` from the archived PLAN.md's `lang:` frontmatter (the same field Step 9d reads — set by `action:promote` Step 0; English fallback if absent) so the deck's UI chrome matches the language the plan's own content is already written in. This rewrites `scv/archive/<slug>/<slug>.deck.html` (combining PLAN + FEATURE_ARCHITECTURE + TESTS into one scrollable document) so it's committed with the archive. In a nested module, use the module's path (`<SCV_DIR>/archive/<slug>`). If Node/pnpm are missing, relay the error and continue — the archive itself is unaffected.

#### Step 9b.1 — Conversation archive (v0.9.0+, optional)

If the just-archived plan's `raw_sources` includes a path under `scv/.conversations/`, the original conversation file is still in `scv/.conversations/` (active). Offer to archive it too:

```
Ask: "This plan was started from a action:help conversation (`<filename>`). Archive that conversation too?"

[1] "Yes — move to scv/.conversations/archive/"
    description: "The conversation file is moved to scv/.conversations/archive/<filename>. action:help's 'unfinished' list won't show it anymore. Both directories are gitignored — the move only affects your local view."

[2] "No — keep it in scv/.conversations/ for now"
    description: "The conversation stays in the active list. You can still reference it, or archive it manually later. Pick this if you might come back to refine the original idea."
```

**On [1]**: `mkdir -p scv/.conversations/archive && mv scv/.conversations/<file> scv/.conversations/archive/`. Update the moved file's frontmatter: `status: archived`, `archived_at: <ISO>`. Print one-line confirmation.

**On [2]**: do nothing. Conversation stays active.

If `raw_sources` has no `.conversations/` path (the plan came from `scv/raw/` directly, not a `action:help` conversation), skip Step 9b.1 entirely.

### Step 9c — supersede propagation (new · adopts A's `supersedes` declaration)

Condition: archive **actually happened** in Step 9b, and the just-archived PLAN.md's `supersedes:` array is non-empty.

Procedure:
1. `Read` `scv/archive/<A-slug>/PLAN.md` frontmatter. Parse the `supersedes:` array.
2. For each B-slug, **process sequentially**:
   - Verify `scv/archive/<B-slug>/PLAN.md` exists. If not, warn to stderr and skip.
   - If already `status: obsolete`, skip (avoid double-marking).
   - Otherwise, ask **one concise question** (per slug, default Yes):

**Question template (use as-is)**

```
Question: "The plan you just archived ('<A-slug>') declared '<B-slug>' in its supersedes.
           Mark '<B-slug>' as obsolete?"

Options:
[1] "Yes — mark as obsolete (recommended)"
    description:
    "Records that '<B-slug>' is no longer an actively maintained feature and was replaced
     by the just-archived '<A-slug>'.

     What exactly changes?
     - Only 3 fields are added to scv/archive/<B-slug>/PLAN.md frontmatter:
         status: done → obsolete
         obsoleted_at: <today's date>
         obsoleted_by: <A-slug>
     - TESTS.md, ARCHIVED_AT.md, and other files are never touched (immutable archive principle).

     Why is this needed?
     - action:regression will permanently skip '<B-slug>'s TESTS from now on (excluded from
       the regression suite).
     - A year later, even when browsing the archive, the 'why isn't B running anymore?'
       answer remains in PLAN's body, traceable without git history.
     - If status stays 'done', it could be misread as 'completed and still live' — this
       marking clarifies the lifecycle.

     When NOT to pick Yes?
     - If the supersedes declaration was a mistake, pick [2] Skip and remove '<B-slug>'
       from <A-slug>.PLAN.md's supersedes array."

[2] "Skip — runtime skip only"
    description:
    "Don't touch '<B-slug>'s files at all. action:regression still reads <A-slug>.supersedes
     and skips '<B-slug>', but '<B-slug>'.status stays 'done', so in archive listings it
     looks like a 'live feature'. Pick this if the supersedes declaration was a mistake or
     you want to decide later."

[3] "Let me review archive/<B-slug>/ first"
    description:
    "Defer this propagation decision. action:work does NOT stop here — it continues to the
     next supersede target. You can manually mark this slug later, or re-enter via
     action:regression triage."

Default: [1] Yes (pre-selected)
```

Answer handling:
- **[1] Yes**: `Read` → `Edit` `scv/archive/<B-slug>/PLAN.md` frontmatter:
  - `status: done` → `status: obsolete`
  - Add `obsoleted_at: <TODAY>` if missing
  - Add `obsoleted_by: <A-slug>` if missing
  - Don't touch any other field. Never touch TESTS.md, ARCHIVED_AT.md, or any other file.
- **[2] Skip**: Modify nothing. Move to the next slug.
- **[3] Review**: Defer this slug. Move to the next slug.

After processing all supersede targets, summarize to the user:
```
Propagated obsolete marking:
  ✓ <B-slug>    (marked obsolete, obsoleted_by: <A-slug>)
  — <C-slug>    (user chose Skip)
  ? <D-slug>    (user chose Review — not marked)
```

### Step 9d — PR auto-creation (optional, v0.3+)

Condition: archive actually happened in Step 9b.

#### Step 9d-prep — Video retention period (one-time)

When `action:work` is creating its first PR and `.env` does not have `SCV_ATTACHMENTS_RETENTION_DAYS`, ask the user one concise question (and never again):

```
Question: "How long to keep video attachments after PR merge?
           (Auto-deleted from the scv-attachments orphan branch.)"
options:
[1] "3 days (default · recommended)"
    description:
    "Quick cleanup after merge. Just enough buffer for a brief post-merge review.
     Usually sufficient. Minimum storage accumulation."
[2] "7 days"
    description:
    "One week. Referenceable through the next sprint after merge. Slightly more
     conservative."
[3] "30 days"
    description:
    "One month. Retained through quarterly retros. Video storage accumulates more
     but supports long-term traceability."
[4] "Never — don't delete"
    description:
    "Permanent retention. The orphan branch's storage will keep growing — choose
     this only if you want a long-term archive."
```

After the answer, the host agent uses `Edit` to append one line to `.env` (creating `.env` if absent):
```
SCV_ATTACHMENTS_RETENTION_DAYS=<N>   # or 'never'
```

#### Step 9d-main — PR creation confirmation

**Ask once** (default Yes):

```
Question: "Open a PR for the just-archived '<slug>' now?"
options:
[1] "Yes — auto-create PR (recommended)"
    description:
    "The following happens automatically:
    - Read `lang:` from the archived PLAN.md frontmatter (set by action:promote
      Step 0). All section headings, fixed phrases, and the host agent-written narrative
      in the PR body — including the commit message, PR title, and PR body
      footer — are written in this language. pr-helper.sh's section labels
      (## Summary / ## Tests / ## Architecture diagrams / 🗂 Archived ...)
      branch on this lang field (en / ko / ja, with English fallback for
      free-form / unset).
    - Assemble PR body from key sections of PLAN.md / TESTS.md / ARCHIVED_AT.md
    - If FEATURE_ARCHITECTURE.md exists, inline its two Mermaid blocks (Component
      data flow + Position in whole architecture) into the PR body — GitHub and
      GitLab auto-render them, so reviewers see the design at a glance and can
      flag inaccuracies in the comment thread.
    - Move test-results/ screenshots (PNG/JPG) into .scv-pr-artifacts/<slug>/
      (cleared from test-results/ to keep disk clean). Commit them on the PR branch.
    - Push test-results/ videos (.webm/.mp4) via lib/attachments.sh's git-orphan
      backend onto the scv-attachments orphan branch (zero impact on the PR
      branch's git history). Local video files are deleted right after push.
    - PR body embeds video markdown via GitHub raw URL → inline playback in the
      PR page. Manifest updated.
    - Auto-deletion N days after PR merge (self-amortizing — runs on next
      pr-helper invocation).
    - If the plan has an epic, base branch = epic/<epic-slug> (otherwise main).
      If the epic branch doesn't exist on origin, it's auto-created from origin/main.
    - Push current feature branch + gh pr create + attachments_upload + gh api
      PATCH to replace the placeholder.
    - Print PR URL.

    Prerequisites:
    - Current git branch is a feature branch (not main).
    - gh CLI authenticated (gh auth status).
    - test-results/ screenshots and videos prepared by your test tooling
      (Playwright video: 'on' auto-config recommended — Step 5b).
    - GitHub-only for video attachments (GitLab etc. coming in v0.5)."

[2] "Skip — I'll open the PR manually"
    description:
    "SCV doesn't open a PR. You can create it later via git/gh, or re-enter
     this step by re-invoking action:work."
```

**On [1] Yes**:

```
bash ${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/pr-helper.sh [<SCV_DIR>] <slug>
```

The helper reads `archive/<slug>/PLAN.md`'s `epic:` / `kind:` to determine the base branch and performs commit + push + gh pr create. The last line of the output should be `PR created: <URL>` — report that URL to the user.

Failure cases:
- Current branch equals the base branch (e.g., invoked on main) → tell the user to switch to a feature branch. SCV does NOT auto-switch (preserves the user's working context).
- gh CLI not authenticated → tell the user to run `gh auth login`.
- No changes to commit (already committed/pushed) → just runs gh pr create.

**On [2] Skip**: terminate quietly. Continue to Step 9e (epic refactor notice).

### Step 9e — Epic completion refactor notice (optional)

Only when the just-archived PLAN has `epic:` and `kind: feature`. Check whether all features of this epic are archived:

```bash
# Glob scv/promote/*/PLAN.md and scv/archive/*/PLAN.md, count epic match + kind=feature
remaining_features_in_promote=$(grep -l "^epic: <epic-slug>$" scv/promote/*/PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | xargs -I{} grep -L "^kind: refactor$" {} 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
existing_refactor=$(grep -l "^epic: <epic-slug>$" scv/{archive,promote}/*/PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | xargs grep -l "^kind: refactor$" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
```

If both:
- `remaining_features_in_promote == 0` (all features of the epic are archived)
- `existing_refactor == 0` (no refactor PLAN exists yet)

→ One-line user notice + one concise question:

```
"All features of epic <epic-slug> are archived.
 Per PROMOTE.md §8e, it's time to create the integration refactor PLAN.

 Question: "Create the refactor PLAN scaffold now?"
 options:
 [1] "Yes — create refactor PLAN (recommended)"
     description:
     "Generates scv/promote/<TODAY>-<author>-<epic-slug>-refactor/ with PLAN.md +
      TESTS.md scaffold. PLAN.md has frontmatter pre-set:
        kind: refactor

**On [1] Yes**: the host agent directly creates the folder + PLAN.md + TESTS.md scaffold via `Write`. Auto-include the epic's archived feature slugs in the PLAN.md Summary section.

**On [2] Later**: Terminate quietly.

## Flag semantics

- `<slug>` — required for actual work; optional when you just want to list plans. Partial match supported (helper fuzzy-resolves suffixes).
- `--archive` — Skip implementation; move `promote/<slug>/` → `archive/<slug>/` and write `ARCHIVED_AT.md`. Useful for manually archiving plans whose tests passed outside `action:work`.
- `--reason="..."` — Used only with `--archive`; goes into `ARCHIVED_AT.md` body.

## Never

- Archive without tests passing (or without explicit user override).
- Read Related Documents beyond what the step needs.
- Skip the test execution and declare done.
- Silently split or merge documents — always confirm with the user.
