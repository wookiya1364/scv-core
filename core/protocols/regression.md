# action:regression

{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}

You — the host agent — drive the accumulated regression: **run every archived TESTS that hasn't been superseded or marked obsolete, then triage any failures with the user**.

## Language preference

Resolve the user's preferred language with this priority, then use it for ALL user-facing output (question text, triage prompts, summaries):

1. Project `.env` — `SCV_LANG` (set by `action:help`'s first-time setup).
2. Auto-detect from the user's most recent message language.
3. Default to English.

Technical identifiers stay as-is: file paths, skill invocation names, frontmatter keys (`status`, `obsoleted_at`, `obsoleted_by`, `supersedes`), env var names, SCV terms (`promote`, `archive`, `obsolete`, `flaky`). If `.env` `SCV_LANG` is unset, suggest `action:help` once to lock the preference (don't block — fall back to auto-detect / English for now).

**Non-negotiable rules:**
- **Never modify the body of an archived TESTS.md.** Obsolete marking is done only via 3 frontmatter fields on the archived folder's PLAN.md (`status`, `obsoleted_at`, `obsoleted_by`).
- **Don't force-run a slug declared in another's `supersedes:`** — it's an intentional skip already.
- **`--ci` mode must NOT ask interactive questions.** Verdict is via exit code only.
- **Don't bundle multiple failures into one triage** — each slug gets its own concise question (triage decisions differ per slug).
- Don't auto-mark a failure as obsolete without explicit user approval if there's no `supersedes` declaration covering it.

## Plain language first

Say it the short way first. A reader who understands the short version can ask
for more; a reader lost in the long version asks for nothing.

- One idea per sentence. If a sentence needs a comma to join two clauses, it is
  usually two sentences.
- Use the plain name, not the category name. "the file that records decisions"
  lands faster than "the decision persistence layer".
- Lead with what happens to the user, then why it happens.
- A comparison to something ordinary is worth more than a precise description
  the reader cannot picture. Use one when it gets there faster.
- Define a term of art in the same breath you first use it, or drop the term.
- Detail is not owed up front. Offer it, and give it when asked.

This governs everything the user reads: questions, plans, progress reports,
summaries, and explanations of what went wrong.

## Step 0 — Run

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/regression.sh" {{SCV_ARGS}}
```

Parse the header keys: `MODE:`, `TODAY:`, `SCOPE:`, `TAG_FILTER:`, `TOTAL_SLUGS:`, `SKIPPED_SUPERSEDED:`, `SKIPPED_OBSOLETE:`, `SKIPPED_SCENARIOS:`, `EXECUTED_SLUGS:`, `PASSED_SLUGS:`, `FAILED_SLUGS:`. Blocks: `=== skip list ===`, `=== execution ===`, `=== summary ===`. If failures occur, a `failed_slugs:` line is present.

Hosts with subagent / parallel-workflow support MAY fan out independent slugs to parallel runs (one slug per agent via `--only <slug>`, each slug's `## How to run` is self-contained); skip-graph resolution, verdict rules, and the per-slug triage below are unchanged (v0.22.0+).

## Step 1 — All-pass path

If `FAILED_SLUGS: 0`:

1. Give the user a **2–4 line summary** (TOTAL_SLUGS / EXECUTED_SLUGS / PASSED_SLUGS / SKIPPED_*). If skips exist, one line with counts of `[superseded]` · `[obsolete]` · `[scenario-skipped]`.
2. Ask once (optional): "Notify the team about this regression result?"
   - Yes → `bash ${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/report.sh "accumulated-regression" passed --event regression-summary --summary "<n> slugs passed, <m> skipped (superseded/obsolete)"`
   - No → terminate.

## Step 2 — Failures present → per-slug 3-way triage

For each slug in `failed_slugs`, ask the user one independent question. Use this template verbatim:

```
Question: "TESTS for '<slug>' failed. How should we handle it?"

Options:
[1] "regression — true regression. I'll fix the current code"
    description:
    "The archived TESTS used to pass and is now broken — likely one of the recent changes
     touched '<slug>'s feature unintentionally.

     the host agent's behavior:
     - Won't modify any of this slug's files.
     - If you want, will analyze the failure output and offer 'this line might be the issue'
       suggestions only.
     - Actual code fix is performed by you (action:work or direct edit).
     - After fixing, re-run action:regression to confirm green."

[2] "obsolete — this TESTS is intentionally broken now"
    description:
    "'<slug>' is no longer an actively maintained feature and should be permanently excluded
     from the regression suite. Use this when a new plan was written without declaring it in
     supersedes, or when environment changes force deprecation.

     What exactly changes?
     - Only 3 fields are added to scv/archive/<slug>/PLAN.md frontmatter:
         status: done → obsolete
         obsoleted_at: <today's date>
         obsoleted_by: manual     (this is the runtime-triage path so 'manual' is fixed)
     - TESTS.md, ARCHIVED_AT.md, and other files are never touched (immutable archive principle).

     Why is this needed?
     - From now on, action:regression permanently skips '<slug>'s TESTS.
     - A year later, even when browsing the archive, the 'why isn't this TESTS running?'
       answer remains in PLAN's body, traceable without git history.
     - If status stays 'done', it could be misread as 'completed and still live'."

[3] "flaky — environmental issue. Let me retry"
    description:
    "Test itself is unstable, or external dependencies (network, timezone, shared resources)
     caused the failure. the host agent reruns this slug only, up to 2 times:
     bash ${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/regression.sh --only <slug>
     - Pass within 2 retries → recorded as 'flaky resolved on retry N' and continue.
     - Still failing → re-fire this 3-way dialog."
```

Answer handling:

- **[1] regression**: Don't modify any files. Offer once: "Want me to analyze the failed output tail with you?" (if yes, use `Read`/`Grep` to explore source, suggestions only). Log `[regression] <slug>` to triage log.
- **[2] obsolete**: Modify files per this procedure:
  1. `Read` `scv/archive/<slug>/PLAN.md`
  2. `Edit` frontmatter — adjust 3 fields:
     - `status: done` → `status: obsolete`
     - Add `obsoleted_at: <TODAY>` if missing
     - Add `obsoleted_by: manual` if missing
  3. Never touch TESTS.md or ARCHIVED_AT.md.
  4. **Decision log append (v0.22.0+)** — the WHY of an obsolete verdict used
     to evaporate with the triage session; record it. Append **one** entry to
     `scv/DECISIONS.md` (append-only — never edit existing entries; seed the
     file via `action:sync` if missing). The entry reuses the handoff decision
     format. **author is mandatory — never write an anonymous entry** (resolve
     via `git config user.name` → `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` → `USER`):

     ```markdown
     ## [<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>] <author> — <slug> marked obsolete

     - verdict: obsolete
     - why: <1–3 lines — WHY this feature is intentionally dead (replaced
       without a supersedes declaration / environment change / deprecation),
       as the user explained it in this triage>
     - refs: scv/archive/<slug>/PLAN.md
     ```
  5. Report one line to the user: "Marked `<slug>` as obsolete (PLAN.md frontmatter + DECISIONS.md entry)."
  6. Log `[obsolete] <slug>` to triage log.
- **[3] flaky**: Run `bash ${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/regression.sh --only <slug> --quiet` up to 2 times. On pass, log `[flaky→pass on retry N] <slug>`. If both retries fail, re-fire the 3-way dialog.

## Step 3 — Final summary

Aggregate the triage log and emit a `=== triage log ===` block to the user:

```
=== triage log ===
[regression] 20260301-sspark-payment-bug
[obsolete]   20260115-kmlee-legacy-login
[flaky→pass on retry 1] 20260201-tester-network-test
```

Ask once (optional): "Notify the team about this regression result?"
- Yes + regressions still remain → `--event regression-failure`
- Yes + everything resolved as obsolete/flaky → `--event regression-summary`
- No → terminate.

## Archive scale guidance

When `scv/archive/` accumulates beyond a few dozen slugs, a no-arg `action:regression` run can take many minutes. Recommend the user partition the suite with `--tag` (e.g. `core`, `payment`, `auth`) on PLAN.md `tags:` and run `--tag core` for fast pre-merge feedback while saving the full suite for nightly / pre-release. If the user has never set tags, suggest once: "consider tagging recent PLANs with a small set of `tags:` (e.g. `core`, `experimental`) so future regressions can scope by tag."

Do not auto-add tags to existing PLANs. The user owns the tag taxonomy.

## Flag semantics

- `<slug-prefix>` — Substring narrowing across archive + promote. Omit to run all.
- `--tag <x>` — Only slugs whose PLAN.md `tags:` array contains `<x>`. **Recommended for large archives** — see Archive scale guidance above.
- `--include-promote` — Default is archive-only. Adds `scv/promote/**/TESTS.md` to the run set (covers in-flight plans before they're archived).
- `--include-obsolete` — Force-runs slugs with `status: obsolete` (auditing / re-validation).
- `--only <slug>` / `--skip <slug>` — Repeatable. Exact match.
- `--ci` — No user interaction. Failures exit 2. Auto-writes `test-results/regression-summary.json`.
- `--quiet` — Trims output of passing scenarios. Used by `action:work`'s Step 9a pre-flight.
- `--json <path>` — Write JSON summary to a specific path (works outside `--ci` too).
- `--timeout <sec>` — Per-scenario timeout. Default 300.

## Never

- Modify the body of archived TESTS.md or ARCHIVED_AT.md.
- Run a slug already declared in another's `supersedes:` outside the runner.
- Ask the user for confirmation in `--ci` mode.
- Bundle multiple failures into a single question.
- Auto-mark an undeclared failure as obsolete without the user's answer.
