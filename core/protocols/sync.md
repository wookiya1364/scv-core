# action:sync

{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}

Run sync. A direct sync invocation authorizes a preview, not immediate writes.

## Language preference

Resolve the user's preferred language with this priority, then use it for any user-facing summary or warnings you print:

1. Project `.env` — `SCV_LANG` (set by `action:help`'s first-time setup).
2. Auto-detect from the user's most recent message language.
3. Default to English.

Technical identifiers (file paths, frontmatter keys like `merge_policy`, skill invocation names, marker tokens like `PROJECT:LOCAL`) stay as-is.

## Step 0 — mandatory preview and approval

Always run the dry-run first, even when the user omitted `--dry-run`:

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/sync.sh" --project-dir "$(pwd)" --dry-run {{SCV_ARGS}}
```

Summarize every `NEW`, `MIGRATE`, `MERGE`, `OVERWRITE`, `FORCED`, and `SKIP`
entry. If a legacy index is the only state index, call out that the shared
`scv/SCV.md` will be seeded while the legacy file remains intact. Ask for one
explicit confirmation before applying. If the user declines, stop after the
preview.

If the script reports an index conflict, stop. Never choose one version,
overwrite either file, or perform a migration automatically.

After approval, run:

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/sync.sh" --project-dir "$(pwd)" {{SCV_ARGS}}
```

Semantics:
- Files with `merge_policy: overwrite` → replaced
- Files with `merge_policy: preserve` → skipped unless `--force FILE` is passed
- Files with `merge_policy: merge-on-markers` (incl. scv/SCV.md, scv/TESTING.md, scv/REPORTING.md) → template replaces file, but existing frontmatter `status`, the `PROJECT:LOCAL` block, and the `SCV:WORKSPACE` block are restored from the local copy
- `scv/promote/*.md` → never touched
- All modified files are backed up to `.scv-backup/<timestamp>/` before changes

The above is **Step 1 — template re-sync**. After it finishes (or is skipped), proceed to Step 2 below.

## Step 2 — Drift detection (v0.11.3+)

After Step 1, ask the user whether to also run drift detection. Default: Yes.

> "Step 1 (template re-sync) complete. Also check active promote slugs for drift between code and PLAN.md / TESTS.md? (Files edited via direct commits, IDE refactors, etc. can leave docs outdated.)"

If user picks Yes, run the drift detector:

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/drift-detect.sh"
```

The helper scans `scv/promote/<slug>/` (archive is **immutable** — never scanned) and emits one record per slug:

```
=== <slug> ===
SCOPE_DEFINED: yes|no
SCOPE_GLOBS: "<g1>" "<g2>" ...               (if scope defined)
SCOPE_OUTSIDE_FILES: <count>                  (files in git diff outside scope)
  <file>
SCOPE_INSIDE_CHANGES: <count>                 (files in git diff inside scope)
  <file>
TESTS_RUN: pass|fail|skipped                  (when no scope: runs TESTS.md "How to run")
  <failure tail>
DRIFT: yes|no|unknown
```

For each slug with `DRIFT: yes`, fire a one user confirmation per slug:

| Mode | Options |
|---|---|
| **scope drift** (outside files) | [1] Update PLAN.md `scope:` to include outside files (code → docs, expand scope) · [2] Update PLAN.md Steps to describe outside changes (code → docs, document new work) · [3] Revert outside files via git (docs → code, restore) · [4] Acknowledge — skip |
| **TESTS run drift** (no scope, tests fail) | [1] Update PLAN.md / TESTS.md to reflect new behavior (code → docs) · [2] Fix code via `action:work <slug>` (docs → code) · [3] Acknowledge — skip |
| **`DRIFT: unknown`** | Informational only. Surface the reason (`no PLAN.md` / `empty scope` / `no run command`) so user can address structural gaps. |

**Default direction**: **code → docs**. SCV assumes the user edited code directly (the more common path) and the docs need to catch up. Reverse direction (docs → code) routes through `action:work <slug>`, not `action:sync`.

**Archive immutability**: drift detection is *promote-only*. `scv/archive/` is never modified by `action:sync` per SCV invariant.

## Never

- Modify `scv/archive/` from `action:sync` (immutable archive principle).
- Auto-apply drift fixes without per-slug user approval.
- Run drift detection if user declined in the Step 2 prompt.
- Apply the template sync without first showing a dry-run summary and receiving
  explicit approval.
- Resolve a shared-index/legacy-index conflict by guessing or overwriting.
