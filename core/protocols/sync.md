# action:sync

{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}

Run sync. A direct sync invocation authorizes a preview, not immediate writes.

## Language preference

Resolve the user's preferred language with this priority, then use it for any user-facing summary or warnings you print:

1. Project `.env` — `SCV_LANG` (set by `action:help`'s first-time setup).
2. Auto-detect from the user's most recent message language.
3. Default to English.

Technical identifiers (file paths, frontmatter keys like `merge_policy`, skill invocation names, marker tokens like `PROJECT:LOCAL`) stay as-is.

## Step 0 — mandatory preview and approval

Always run the dry-run first, even when the user omitted `--dry-run`:

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/sync.sh" --project-dir "$(pwd)" --dry-run {{SCV_ARGS}}
```

Summarize every `NEW`, `MIGRATE`, `MERGE`, `OVERWRITE`, `FORCED`, `SKIP`,
`DELETED`, and `WARN` entry. If a legacy index is the only state index, call
out that the shared `scv/SCV.md` will be seeded while the legacy file remains
intact. Ask for one explicit confirmation before applying. If the user
declines, stop after the preview.

**Retired standard docs (TEMPLATE_VERSION 2.0.0 — deletion, no backup).**
The dry-run lists a `DELETED scv/<file>` entry for each retired standard doc
still present in the project. The retired set is exactly these seven files under `scv/`: `DOMAIN.md` `ARCHITECTURE.md` `DESIGN.md` `AGENTS.md` `TESTING.md` `INTAKE.md` `RALPH_PROMPT.md` (retired 2.0.0).
Applying the sync deletes them **immediately and without any backup** — git
history is the only recovery path. Before asking for the apply confirmation:

1. Open each file listed as `DELETED` and check whether it carries real
   user-authored content (anything beyond the unfilled template's `<TODO>`
   scaffolding or a plain `status:` flip).
2. If real content is present, **first propose migrating the decisions worth
   keeping into a version-controlled team note (e.g. `DECISIONS.md` / a
   journal)** and offer to do that migration now. Only proceed with the sync
   after the user has decided (migrate first, or delete as-is).
3. Files reported as `WARN … (symlink …)` are never deleted by the script —
   relay the warning and let the user remove the link themselves.

No file other than those seven is ever deleted by sync.

If the script reports an index conflict, stop. Never choose one version,
overwrite either file, or perform a migration automatically.

After approval, run:

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/sync.sh" --project-dir "$(pwd)" {{SCV_ARGS}}
```

Semantics:
- Files with `merge_policy: overwrite` → replaced
- Files with `merge_policy: preserve` → skipped unless `--force FILE` is passed
- Files with `merge_policy: merge-on-markers` (incl. scv/SCV.md, scv/REPORTING.md) → template replaces file, but existing frontmatter `status`, the `PROJECT:LOCAL` block, and the `SCV:WORKSPACE` block are restored from the local copy
- `scv/promote/*.md` → never touched
- Retired standard docs (the seven listed in Step 0) → deleted, **no backup**; symlinks are left in place with a `WARN`
- All modified files are backed up to `.scv-backup/<timestamp>/` before changes (deletions are exempt — user decision)

The above is **Step 1 — template re-sync**. After it finishes (or is skipped), proceed to Step 2 below.

## Step 2 — Drift detection (v0.11.3+)

After Step 1, ask the user whether to also run drift detection. Default: Yes.

> "Step 1 (template re-sync) complete. Also check active promote slugs for drift between code and PLAN.md / TESTS.md? (Files edited via direct commits, IDE refactors, etc. can leave docs outdated.)"

If user picks Yes, run the drift detector:

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/drift-detect.sh"
```

The helper scans `scv/promote/<slug>/` (archive is **immutable** — never scanned) and emits one record per slug:

```
=== <slug> ===
SCOPE_DEFINED: yes|no
SCOPE_GLOBS: "<g1>" "<g2>" ...               (if scope defined)
SCOPE_OUTSIDE_FILES: <count>                  (files in git diff outside scope)
  <file>
SCOPE_INSIDE_CHANGES: <count>                 (files in git diff inside scope)
  <file>
TESTS_RUN: pass|fail|skipped                  (when no scope: runs TESTS.md "How to run")
  <failure tail>
DRIFT: yes|no|unknown
```

For each slug with `DRIFT: yes`, fire a one user confirmation per slug:

| Mode | Options |
|---|---|
| **scope drift** (outside files) | [1] Update PLAN.md `scope:` to include outside files (code → docs, expand scope) · [2] Update PLAN.md Steps to describe outside changes (code → docs, document new work) · [3] Revert outside files via git (docs → code, restore) · [4] Acknowledge — skip |
| **TESTS run drift** (no scope, tests fail) | [1] Update PLAN.md / TESTS.md to reflect new behavior (code → docs) · [2] Fix code via `action:work <slug>` (docs → code) · [3] Acknowledge — skip |
| **`DRIFT: unknown`** | Informational only. Surface the reason (`no PLAN.md` / `empty scope` / `no run command`) so user can address structural gaps. |

**Default direction**: **code → docs**. SCV assumes the user edited code directly (the more common path) and the docs need to catch up. Reverse direction (docs → code) routes through `action:work <slug>`, not `action:sync`.

**Archive immutability**: drift detection is *promote-only*. `scv/archive/` is never modified by `action:sync` per SCV invariant.

## Never

- Modify `scv/archive/` from `action:sync` (immutable archive principle).
- Auto-apply drift fixes without per-slug user approval.
- Run drift detection if user declined in the Step 2 prompt.
- Apply the template sync without first showing a dry-run summary and receiving
  explicit approval.
- Resolve a shared-index/legacy-index conflict by guessing or overwriting.
