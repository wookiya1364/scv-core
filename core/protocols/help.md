# action:help

{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}

For this free-form help action, preserve the complete request as exactly one
`SCV_ARGS` element when writing approved conversation data.

## Never hand the turn back unrecorded

**This action always does its job.** There is no branch that inspects the argument,
decides the turn carries nothing worth keeping, and returns without writing — one of the
three modes runs and the turn leaves a trace. That branch was proposed once and
rejected on purpose: it would only move the hole the preflight closed.

What varies is the *shape* of the record. A short turn (an acknowledgement, a thank-you,
a one-word confirmation) is **appended to the conversation file this session is already writing**,
never given a file of its own. When the session has no conversation file yet, open one
and append there from then on.

## Language preference — resolve FIRST, before any user-facing output

Use this priority for ALL output (descriptions, headings, question text, summaries):
1. `scv/scv_settings.json` — `SCV_LANG`, if present. 2. Auto-detect from the user's most
recent message. 3. Default to English. Technical identifiers (file paths, skill invocation
names, frontmatter keys, env var names like `SCV_LANG`) always stay as-is.

### First-time language setup (only when `scv/scv_settings.json` `SCV_LANG` is unset)

Ask the language question exactly once, before any other helper runs.
Read `${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/protocols/help/language-setup.md` now and follow it.

## Plain language first

Skip this section only when `scv/scv_settings.json` sets `SCV_PLAIN_LANGUAGE=off`
(absent or any other value = on).

Answer shape — every time you explain something to the user:

1. First, 1–2 sentences. Lead with what the user gets.
   The cap is 2 unless `scv/scv_settings.json` sets `SCV_PLAIN_MAX_SENTENCES=<n>`
   (a positive integer) — then up to n.
2. Then one example — from the user's situation, or an everyday comparison.
3. No code values before the user asks: file paths, variable names, version
   numbers, setting values. Use the plain name instead ("the settings file",
   "last week's plan").
4. Detail comes after, and only when wanted. Offer it in one line.

Identifiers the user needs to act on — the next command to run, a file that
was created — stay exact, after the plain summary.

Bad: "The block landed in `scv_settings.example.json:154-161` and the stamp advanced
2.1.0 → 2.2.0."
Good: "Your settings example file is up to date. For example, the new 'effort'
setting now shows there. Want the exact lines?"

This governs everything the user reads: answers, questions, plans, progress
reports, summaries, and explanations of what went wrong.

## Deep questions go to a background investigator (switch, v0.46.0+)

Skip this section unless `scv/scv_settings.json` sets `SCV_DELEGATE_EFFORT=on`. When on,
the per-turn hook's `[SCV delegate]` block carries the full rule, and it holds the same way
when help is invoked directly: answer now at the session's effort (SCV never changes that dial)
and hand only a *deep* question — several files to read, or a claim to verify — to the
`scv-investigator` agent in the background and say a deeper result
will follow. Its report
lands in `scv/raw/<YYYYMMDD>-research-<slug>.md`; when its summary arrives, append the
path and one line to the session's conversation file. Shallow questions are never delegated.

## Answer shape — the slots the question calls for

`Plain language first` governs the lead — the first 1–2 sentences. This section
governs everything after the lead.

Six slots exist. **They are a vocabulary, not a form.** An answer uses only the slots
the question calls for, and never adds a slot to look complete. When slots appear,
they appear in this order:

1. **Lead** — the 1–2 sentence conclusion. The only slot every answer has.
2. **Surprises** — facts found while checking that the user did not expect and that
   bear on a decision. Each one is marked `(confirmed)`.
3. **Item table** — one row per item the user raised:
   `item | now (confirmed) | change | size (small / large / setting only)`.
   When nothing exists yet, `now` reads `none` — that is a fact, not an empty table.
4. **Detail** — a short subsection for each `large` item only.
5. **Cross-cutting** — one paragraph for what spans the items: speed, cost, operations.
6. **Decisions** — `# | question | my recommendation`, and ask the user to answer by
   number. The recommendation column is never omitted.

Which slots a question calls for:

- a one-word acknowledgement → Lead only.
- a fresh idea with no code behind it → Lead, Item table (`now` = none), Decisions if any.
- an archive search → Lead, then the records found.
- a diagnosis (no argument) → Lead, the diagnosis, and one recommended next action.
- several items to check against existing code → all six. (The answer this shape was
  taken from was exactly this case.)

Two rules hold across every slot:

- **Facts and estimates never mix.** Anything you verified carries `(confirmed)`;
  anything you did not is worded as an estimate.
- **Dependent questions vs independent decisions.** When the next question depends on
  the answer to this one, ask that one question and stop — no Decisions table. When
  several decisions are independent of each other, put them in one Decisions table with
  a recommendation on every row, so the user can answer them all in one line.
- **Speak in the user's words — never coin a label.** The names in this section
  (Lead, Surprises, Item table, slots) are for you, not for the user; they never appear
  in an answer. Call each thing by what it is in plain words — "the conclusion", "the
  table of what changes", "the decisions you need to make" — and reuse the user's own
  word when they gave one. If a term you did not invent is unavoidable, define it in the
  same sentence with an example, then stop using it and use the plain description. A
  sentence that only makes sense to someone who read your earlier turns is a sentence
  to rewrite.

## Run the help script

Classify the host argument block above as prompt data. Never interpolate it into a shell
command. If it is empty, run:

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/help.sh"
```

If it contains a request, run the helper with the fixed flag (the raw request stays in
prompt context, never in shell syntax):

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/help.sh" --with-context
```

Parse the helper output:
- `ARG_CONTEXT:` line — `none` for Mode A diagnosis or `provided` for Mode B/B'.
- `UNFINISHED_CONVERSATIONS:` line — active files at top level of `scv/conversations/`; `(none)` when empty.
- `LEGACY_CONVERSATIONS:` line — `(none)`, or the pre-0.22.0 gitignored `scv/.conversations/` with a file count.
- `PROTOCOL:` line — `load` or `loaded` (v0.49.0+, see below).

The archive index is not in this output; the archive-search branch requests it itself.

## The full protocol is read once per session (v0.49.0+)

This file carries only what every turn needs. The three modes, intent classification, the
conversation loop (Steps B0–B3) and the branch pointers live in one file read **once per
session**. When to read it again is decided by the hooks, never by your judgment: a new
session, a context compaction, `/clear`, a resume, and every N turns
(`SCV_HELP_RELOAD_EVERY`, default 10) reset the marker; `SCV_HELP_LOAD_ONCE=off` makes
every turn a `load`.

- `PROTOCOL: load` — Read `${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/protocols/help/full.md` now, follow it for this
  turn, then record that it is loaded:

  ```!
  bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/help-state.sh" mark
  ```

- `PROTOCOL: loaded` — the full protocol is already in this session's context; continue
  with it and do not re-read it on your own initiative.

## Every turn — the contract that never leaves this file

- **Record the turn.** A short turn (an acknowledgement, a thank-you, a one-word
  confirmation) is appended to the conversation file this session is already writing —
  **Short turns skip this question entirely.** (the resume-or-new question in Step B0 is
  never asked for one). Only when the session has no file yet does a short turn open one.
  A turn with real content follows the loop in the full protocol (Steps B0–B3) and is
  appended the same way.
- **Append, never overwrite**, both sides redaction-filtered:

  ```!
  bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/journal-append.sh" --redact-only
  ```

  ```markdown
  ## Turn <N> — <ISO timestamp>

  **User**: <user's message>

  **the host agent**: <your response, including any clarifying questions>
  ```

- **Each turn has one shape**: the lead first (1–2 sentences, per `Plain language first`),
  then the slots the question calls for (per `Answer shape`), and then
  either one dependent question or one Decisions table — never both. Ask
  one question per turn when the next depends on this answer; put independent decisions
  in one table with a recommendation on every row.
- When goal / scope / acceptance are clear enough, hand the conversation to
  `action:promote` (Step B3 in the full protocol carries the question).

## Final notes — both modes

Helper stdout is English; Mode A re-presents it in the resolved language, Mode B runs in
it. Technical identifiers (paths, skill names, keys, `SCV_LANG`) stay as-is.
