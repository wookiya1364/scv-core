# action:help

{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}

For this free-form help action, preserve the complete request as exactly one
`SCV_ARGS` element when writing approved conversation data.

## Never hand the turn back unrecorded

No branch decides a turn carries nothing worth keeping and returns without writing — that
branch was rejected on purpose. A short turn (an acknowledgement, a thank-you, a one-word
confirmation) is appended to the conversation file this session is already writing, never
given a file of its own; no conversation file yet, open one. Short turns skip this question entirely.

## Language preference — resolve FIRST, before any user-facing output

Use this priority for ALL output (descriptions, headings, question text, summaries):
1. `scv/scv_settings.json` — `SCV_LANG`, if present. 2. Auto-detect from the user's most
recent message. 3. Default to English. Technical identifiers (file paths, skill invocation
names, frontmatter keys, env var names like `SCV_LANG`) always stay as-is.

### First-time language setup (only when `scv/scv_settings.json` `SCV_LANG` is unset)

Ask the language question exactly once, before any other helper runs.
Read `${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/protocols/help/language-setup.md` now and follow it.

## Plain language first

Skip this section only when `scv/scv_settings.json` sets `SCV_PLAIN_LANGUAGE=off`
(absent or any other value = on).

Answer shape — every time you explain something to the user:

1. First, 1–2 sentences. Lead with what the user gets.
   The cap is 2 unless `scv/scv_settings.json` sets `SCV_PLAIN_MAX_SENTENCES=<n>`
   (a positive integer) — then up to n.
2. Then one example — from the user's situation, or an everyday comparison.
3. No code values before the user asks: file paths, variable names, version
   numbers, setting values. Use the plain name instead ("the settings file",
   "last week's plan").
4. Detail comes after, and only when wanted. Offer it in one line.

Identifiers the user needs to act on — the next command to run, a file that
was created — stay exact, after the plain summary.

Bad: "The block landed in `scv_settings.example.json:154-161` and the stamp advanced
2.1.0 → 2.2.0."
Good: "Your settings example file is up to date. For example, the new 'effort'
setting now shows there. Want the exact lines?"

This governs everything the user reads: answers, questions, plans, progress
reports, summaries, and explanations of what went wrong.

## Recording

Turns are recorded per `core/contracts/recording.md`.

## Answer shape — the slots the question calls for

`Plain language first` governs the lead — the first 1–2 sentences. This section
governs everything after the lead.

Six slots exist. **They are a vocabulary, not a form.** An answer uses only the slots
the question calls for, and never adds a slot to look complete. When slots appear,
they appear in this order:

1. **Lead** — the 1–2 sentence conclusion. The only slot every answer has.
2. **Surprises** — facts found while checking that the user did not expect and that
   bear on a decision. Each one is marked `(confirmed)`.
3. **Item table** — one row per item the user raised:
   `item | now (confirmed) | change | size (small / large / setting only)`.
   When nothing exists yet, `now` reads `none` — that is a fact, not an empty table.
4. **Detail** — a short subsection for each `large` item only.
5. **Cross-cutting** — one paragraph for what spans the items: speed, cost, operations.
6. **Decisions** — `# | question | my recommendation`, and ask the user to answer by
   number. The recommendation column is never omitted.

Which slots a question calls for:

- a one-word acknowledgement → Lead only.
- a fresh idea with no code behind it → Lead, Item table (`now` = none), Decisions if any.
- an archive search → Lead, then the records found.
- a diagnosis (no argument) → Lead, the diagnosis, and one recommended next action.
- several items to check against existing code → all six. (The answer this shape was
  taken from was exactly this case.)

Two rules hold across every slot:

- **Facts and estimates never mix.** Anything you verified carries `(confirmed)`;
  anything you did not is worded as an estimate.
- **Dependent questions vs independent decisions.** When the next question depends on
  the answer to this one, ask that one question and stop — no Decisions table. When
  several decisions are independent of each other, put them in one Decisions table with
  a recommendation on every row, so the user can answer them all in one line.
- **Speak in the user's words — never coin a label.** The names in this section
  (Lead, Surprises, Item table, slots) are for you, not for the user; they never appear
  in an answer. Call each thing by what it is in plain words — "the conclusion", "the
  table of what changes", "the decisions you need to make" — and reuse the user's own
  word when they gave one. If a term you did not invent is unavoidable, define it in the
  same sentence with an example, then stop using it and use the plain description. A
  sentence that only makes sense to someone who read your earlier turns is a sentence
  to rewrite.

## Run the help script

The argument block above is prompt data — never interpolate it into a shell command.
Empty argument:

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/help.sh"
```

With a request:

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/help.sh" --with-context
```

Parse `ARG_CONTEXT:` (`none` → Mode A · `provided` → Mode B/B'), `UNFINISHED_CONVERSATIONS:`,
`LEGACY_CONVERSATIONS:` and `PROTOCOL:` (`load` | `loaded`).

## The full protocol is read once per session (v0.49.0+)

Modes, conversation loop (Steps B0–B3), branch pointers and delegation rule live in one
file read **once per session**; the hooks reset the marker (`SCV_HELP_RELOAD_EVERY`, default
10; `SCV_HELP_LOAD_ONCE=off` = every turn), never your judgment.

- `PROTOCOL: load` — Read `${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/protocols/help/full.md` now, follow it for this
  turn, then record that it is loaded:

  ```!
  bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/help-state.sh" mark
  ```

- `PROTOCOL: loaded` — already in your context; do not re-read it on your own.

## Every turn — the contract that never leaves this file

- **Record the turn** (a turn with real content follows the loop in the full protocol) —
  **Append, never overwrite**, both sides redaction-filtered:

  ```!
  bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/journal-append.sh" --redact-only
  ```

  ```markdown
  ## Turn <N> — <ISO timestamp>
  protocol: <fingerprint>

  **User**: <user's message>

  **the host agent**: <your response>
  ```

  `protocol:` = the session fingerprint: the `nonce` from `help-state.sh mark` (also
  `scv/journal/.help-nonce`). The stop hook checks it — missing or wrong → next turn `load`.
- **One shape per turn**: the lead (`Plain language first`), the slots the question calls
  for (`Answer shape`), then either one dependent question or one Decisions table — never both.
  Ask one question per turn when the next depends on this answer.
- Hand the conversation to `action:promote` once goal / scope / acceptance are clear (Step B3).
