# action:report

{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}

Run the reporter for the given phase and status. `phase-name` should be quoted if it contains spaces. `status` is one of `passed`, `failed`, `info`.

## Language preference

Resolve the user's preferred language with this priority, then use it for any user-facing summary you print after the script runs:

1. Project `.env` — `SCV_LANG` (set by `action:help`'s first-time setup).
2. Auto-detect from the user's most recent message language.
3. Default to English.

Technical identifiers (skill invocation names, env var names like `NOTIFIER_PROVIDER`, file paths, statuses `passed`/`failed`/`info`) stay as-is.

```!
bash "${SCV_CORE_ROOT}/scripts/report.sh" {{SCV_ARGS}}
```

On success prints `OK <thread_ref>` (Slack `ts` or Discord message id). On failure prints `ERROR <reason>` and exits non-zero.

After calling this, continue your Ralph iteration. Do not call Slack/Discord APIs directly from the loop — always go through this command so REPORTING.md and .env remain the single source of truth.

## Plain language first

Say it the short way first. A reader who understands the short version can ask
for more; a reader lost in the long version asks for nothing.

- One idea per sentence. If a sentence needs a comma to join two clauses, it is
  usually two sentences.
- Use the plain name, not the category name. "the file that records decisions"
  lands faster than "the decision persistence layer".
- Lead with what happens to the user, then why it happens.
- A comparison to something ordinary is worth more than a precise description
  the reader cannot picture. Use one when it gets there faster.
- Define a term of art in the same breath you first use it, or drop the term.
- Detail is not owed up front. Offer it, and give it when asked.

This governs everything the user reads: questions, plans, progress reports,
summaries, and explanations of what went wrong.
