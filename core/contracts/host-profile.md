# Host profile contract

A wrapper supplies one line-oriented profile when it vendors SCV Core. The
profile is treated as data and is validated before any value is used.

Required keys:

| Key | Contract |
|---|---|
| `SCV_HOST_PROFILE_API` | Must equal `1`. |
| `SCV_HOST_ID` | Lowercase identifier: letters, digits, and hyphens. |
| `SCV_HOST_LABEL` | Single-line name used in generated guidance. |
| `SCV_ACTION_TEMPLATE` | Contains exactly one `{action}` placeholder. |
| `SCV_ARGUMENT_STYLE` | `template-string` for a host-provided argument template, or `argv-array` for a safely quoted argument array. |
| `SCV_STATE_INDEX` | Must be `SCV.md`, the shared project state index. |
| `SCV_LEGACY_STATE_INDEXES` | Optional `|`-separated legacy basenames that Core may read when `SCV.md` is absent and may finalize as pointers during an explicit migration. |
| `SCV_ROOT_ENV` | Uppercase environment-variable identifier for the installed payload root. |
| `SCV_GRAPH_SKILL_PATHS` | Optional `|`-separated file globs. Literal `$HOME` is expanded at runtime without evaluating shell code. |
| `SCV_UPDATE_OWNER` | Must be `adapter`. |
| `SCV_MODEL_POLICY_OWNER` | Must be `adapter`. |

Unknown or duplicate keys, shell substitutions, command separators, and
multiline values are rejected. The two adapter-owned actions stay outside the
canonical payload because installation and model selection are runtime
capabilities.

Canonical protocols use `{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}` for the host-supplied
prompt-data section and `{{SCV_ARGS}}` only for a parsed argument array.
During `template-string` materialization, the raw host template appears once
as prompt data and every dynamic shell fence becomes an ordinary Bash example.
The agent must parse that data into separately quoted `SCV_ARGS` elements; raw
template text never appears in an immediate-execution shell block. During
`argv-array` materialization, the adapter-provided array is expanded as
individually quoted elements. Wrappers may not supply an arbitrary shell
expression.

Free-form help text is not transported through shell syntax. The protocol
classifies the prompt data itself and calls the helper with a fixed
`--with-context` control flag when archive context is needed. If it later
writes a conversation, it uses exactly one parsed data element.

A dollar-prefixed action template must have the exact shape
`$name:{action}`. Materialized shell files bind `name` to the literal `$name`
spelling, which makes action references safe under `set -u` in unquoted,
double-quoted, and single-quoted output contexts.

The vendoring tool copies the validated profile to `core/host-profile.env` and
materializes the action syntax, root variable, and host label in a
wrapper-local projection. The state-index filename remains shared across
wrappers. Canonical source releases remain
host-neutral and checksummed.

A Core compatibility pointer contains this exact marker so every wrapper
distinguishes it from an independent state copy:

```text
<!-- SCV:HOST-POINTER target=SCV.md -->
```

If multiple non-pointer state files exist and differ byte-for-byte, read-only
actions report the conflict and mutating sync stops without changing files.
Readable state plus `scv/PROMOTE.md` remains hydrated during that conflict;
conflict and hydration are separate axes.

Wrappers must delegate state inspection and pointer finalization to
`core/scripts/state-index.sh`. They must not implement a second marker,
conflict, or hydration resolver.
