# Host profile contract

A wrapper supplies one line-oriented profile when it vendors SCV Core. The
profile is treated as data and is validated before any value is used.

Required keys:

| Key | Contract |
|---|---|
| `SCV_HOST_PROFILE_API` | Must equal `1`. |
| `SCV_HOST_ID` | Lowercase identifier: letters, digits, and hyphens. |
| `SCV_HOST_LABEL` | Single-line name used in generated guidance. |
| `SCV_ACTION_TEMPLATE` | Contains exactly one `{action}` placeholder. |
| `SCV_ARGUMENT_STYLE` | `template-string` for a host-provided argument template, or `argv-array` for a safely quoted argument array. |
| `SCV_STATE_INDEX` | Must be `SCV.md`, the shared project state index. |
| `SCV_LEGACY_STATE_INDEXES` | Optional `|`-separated legacy basenames that Core may read when `SCV.md` is absent and may finalize as pointers during an explicit migration. |
| `SCV_ROOT_ENV` | Uppercase environment-variable identifier for the installed payload root. |
| `SCV_GRAPH_SKILL_PATHS` | **Deprecated (0.51.0)** — still accepted, ignored. The docs graph is built by `scripts/graph.sh` from the repository (bash + jq); no host skill is consulted. Wrappers may stop setting it. |
| `SCV_UPDATE_OWNER` | Must be `adapter`. |
| `SCV_MODEL_POLICY_OWNER` | Must be `adapter`. |

Optional keys:

| Key | Contract |
|---|---|
| `SCV_PROMPTING_GUIDES` | **0.59.0+.** Folder holding the wrapper's per-model prompting guides and their `INDEX.tsv`, as a path relative to the Core root (the directory that holds `host-profile.env`) or absolute. Path characters only (`A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ / -`). When absent or empty the per-model prompting step stays silent (`GUIDE: none`). The guides themselves stay in the wrapper — Core payload never carries provider or model names. Index format: `protocols/help/prompt-refine.md`. |
| `SCV_AUTO_PROMPT_TAGS` | **0.63.0+.** Tag names, separated by single spaces, that mark an input the host sent on its own rather than a person — a background-task notification, for example. An input made only of such tagged blocks and whitespace (it starts with `<name>` or `<name `, ends with `</name>`, and no closing tag is followed by anything but whitespace or another tagged block) is an automatic turn — text a person wrote before, after or between the blocks makes it a person turn: the per-turn hook opens no new turn (no turn token, no registration block, no routing or diagnosis, no help reload count, scheduled warnings wait for the next person turn); once the person turn before it has ended, the stop hook and the write gate skip the registration check for it. Names only — lowercase letters, digits and hyphens; Core adds the angle brackets. Empty or absent: every input is a person turn, exactly as before. |
| `SCV_CHOICE_TOOL` | **0.64.0+.** Name of the host's tool that shows the user selectable options (a letter, then letters, digits, `_` or `-`; at most 64 characters). When set, every decision SCV puts to the user goes through that tool, the per-turn hook says so in one line, and the stop hook blocks a final message that asks in text — the rule is `contracts/choices.md`. Empty or absent: decisions are asked as before (a numbered table answered by number) and both hooks print and decide exactly as before. A project turns the rule off with the setting `SCV_CHOICE_GATE=off`. |
| `SCV_CHOICE_OFF_WHEN` | **0.64.0+.** One `NAME=VALUE` condition on the hook environment that marks a run in which the host offers no choice tool — a headless run where no person can answer, for example (`NAME` is an environment variable name; `VALUE` is letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `:` or `-`, at most 64 characters). When the variable holds that value, the run counts as naming no tool: no per-turn line, no stop-hook block, decisions asked as a numbered table. Empty or absent: no condition — the tool counts as present whenever `SCV_CHOICE_TOOL` is set. |
| `SCV_SESSION_ENV` | **0.65.0+.** The name of the environment variable through which the host hands the current session id to the shell commands the model runs (the same value as the hook payload's `session_id`). Commands the model runs itself — `register`, and help's guide decision — then find the session's own per-turn state even when several person sessions share one repository. Used only when that session's state folder already exists. Empty or absent: such commands go to the session that opened a person turn most recently (the single-session case is unchanged). |
| `SCV_AUTO_PROMPT_PREFIX` | **0.65.0+.** Plain text (one line, no angle brackets, at most 200 characters) the host puts before an automatic input's tagged blocks — the first line of a message another session sent, for example. Stripped from the start before the `SCV_AUTO_PROMPT_TAGS` rule is applied. Such inputs may never reach the per-turn hook; the stop hook then classifies the input that opened the turn from the transcript and, once the person turn before it has ended, skips the registration check for that turn. Empty or absent: nothing is stripped. |
| `SCV_AUTO_PROMPT_SUFFIX` | **0.65.0+.** The start of the plain-text note the host appends after the last closing tag of such an input (same shape rules as the prefix). The note — from this text to the end, found in the last 2048 characters right after a closing tag — is stripped before the tag rule is applied. Empty or absent: nothing is stripped. |

Unknown or duplicate keys, shell substitutions, command separators, and
multiline values are rejected. The two adapter-owned actions stay outside the
canonical payload because installation and model selection are runtime
capabilities.

Canonical protocols use `{{SCV_HOST_ARGUMENT_CONTEXT}}` for the host-supplied
prompt-data section and `{{SCV_ARGS}}` only for a parsed argument array.
During `template-string` materialization, the raw host template appears once
as prompt data and every dynamic shell fence becomes an ordinary Bash example.
The agent must parse that data into separately quoted `SCV_ARGS` elements; raw
template text never appears in an immediate-execution shell block. During
`argv-array` materialization, the adapter-provided array is expanded as
individually quoted elements. Wrappers may not supply an arbitrary shell
expression.

Free-form help text is not transported through shell syntax. The protocol
classifies the prompt data itself and calls the helper with a fixed
`--with-context` control flag when archive context is needed. If it later
writes a conversation, it uses exactly one parsed data element.

A dollar-prefixed action template must have the exact shape
`$name:{action}`. Materialized shell files bind `name` to the literal `$name`
spelling, which makes action references safe under `set -u` in unquoted,
double-quoted, and single-quoted output contexts.

The vendoring tool copies the validated profile to `core/host-profile.env` and
materializes the action syntax, root variable, and host label in a
wrapper-local projection. The state-index filename remains shared across
wrappers. Canonical source releases remain
host-neutral and checksummed.

A Core compatibility pointer contains this exact marker so every wrapper
distinguishes it from an independent state copy:

```text
<!-- SCV:HOST-POINTER target=SCV.md -->
```

If multiple non-pointer state files exist and differ byte-for-byte, read-only
actions report the conflict and mutating sync stops without changing files.
Readable state plus `scv/PROMOTE.md` remains hydrated during that conflict;
conflict and hydration are separate axes.

Wrappers must delegate state inspection and pointer finalization to
`core/scripts/state-index.sh`. They must not implement a second marker,
conflict, or hydration resolver.
