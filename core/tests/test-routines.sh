# test-routines.sh — scv/routines/ maintenance-routine layer (v0.22.0+).
#
# Covers TESTS.md scenarios 1–8 of 20260807-wookiya1364-routines:
#   1. convention seeding — hydrate seeds ONLY scv/routines/README.md (schema
#      documented); sync propagates it to pre-routines projects
#   2. routine --list — table of name·cadence for 2 routines; guidance line
#      when none are defined
#   3. execution contract — routine.md instructs (a) task/guardrails/exit
#      compliance, (b) no direct writes to permanent branches, (c) optional
#      report-format summary, (d) host scheduling examples (protocol assert)
#   4. unknown routine — clear error + available list, exit 1
#   5. four built-in templates (+3 codebase examples) pass the frontmatter lint
#   6. outdated-verifier wiring — readpath outdated OUTDATED-CANDIDATE output
#      is the routine's declared input (script-signal assert)
#   7. action catalog 15 — actions.json carries `routine` exactly once
#   8. no scheduling ownership — zero cron-registration/daemon code in the
#      routine script/protocol/templates (guidance text only)
#
# Run: bash core/tests/test-routines.sh
