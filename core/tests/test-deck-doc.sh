# test-deck-doc.sh — regression tests for the buildless action:deck DOCUMENT path.
#
# Body/structural assertions target a --no-source render (NS) so a grep can NEVER
# accidentally match the raw-markdown side panel / print appendix (that mistake let
# several fixes pass even when reverted). Covers:
#   1. document (default) is a scrollable HTML, NOT the React slide SPA
#   2. every deck block type renders (para/bullets/goals/kpi/table/mermaid/code/callout/subhead)
#   2b. structure fidelity: nested lists → real nested <ul>/<ol> (no fusing, correct numbering),
#       H3 kept, KPI anchored-but-suffix-tolerant
#   2c. M1: ordered list with sub-bullets keeps correct <ol> numbering (sub-list nested in <li>)
#   2d. transform edge cases: loose multi-paragraph item space-joined; empty H2 kept / empty H1 dropped
#   3. mermaid = CDN with an automatic text fallback (offline / closed network)
#   4. --mermaid none renders mermaid as source text (no CDN script)
#   5. --no-source drops the raw-markdown section; unknown flags are rejected
#   6. the quality/gap lint surfaces and the source is escaped (no HTML injection)
#   7. INVARIANT: doc transform == slide transform (byte-identical); slide-path stdout contract
#   8. the renderer is zero-dependency (no bare-specifier imports)
#   9. slug-folder input combines PLAN + FEATURE_ARCHITECTURE + TESTS into one <slug>.deck.html
#      (missing files handled; a non-spine file's frontmatter/H1 does NOT leak as a section)
#  10. scv:deck's defining trait — the raw markdown is an ALWAYS-ON side panel (not a
#      footnote): single source = no tabs, multi-source (slug combine) = one tab per
#      file with the pristine (unstripped) text; toggle button + print-only appendix.
#  11. screen-by-screen paging (‹›  arrows, dots, jump-nav, arrow keys) with the side
#      panel auto-tracking the current page (tab switch + <mark> highlight); mermaid
#      is scoped to the active page only (a hidden-page render sizes to zero and mermaid
#      never retries it) with a beforeprint pass so print/PDF still gets every diagram.
#  12. dark-default theme with a header toggle (pre-paint init from localStorage, no
#      flash-of-light) + a draggable side-panel resize handle (same bounds as the
#      original SourcePanel: 320px floor, main content keeps ≥420px).
#  13. ```screen fenced JSON → wireframe mockup (the host agent-authored, per commands/promote.md
#      Step 6.4): valid JSON renders the dark scv-native wf-* skin; malformed JSON never
#      crashes the build — it becomes a visible error callout instead.
#  14. v0.18.0 pre-release fixes (adversarial review): array-type-confusion crash guards,
#      card recursion depth cap, BADGE_TONE prototype-chain guard, screen-fence type-key
#      override guard, WCAG contrast fix (on-primary/on-warn), resize breakpoint fix,
#      single-page pagination-UI gating.
#  15. i18n — English is the DEFAULT UI-chrome language (buttons/headings/lint text; the
#      user's own PLAN.md/TESTS.md/screen-mockup CONTENT is never translated); --lang /
#      SCV_LANG select korean/japanese, same SCV_LANG convention as
#      scripts/render-template.sh (anything unrecognized falls back to English); the
#      doc/slide byte-identical invariant holds under a non-default SCV_LANG too (both
#      CLIs read the same env var).
#  16. screen-mockup theme override (project-token priority): absent by default (scv
#      skin), a valid `theme` field emits validated inline --wf-* vars with COMPUTED
#      on-primary/tint derivatives, and invalid/malicious values are dropped silently
#      (never reach the HTML in any form — no CSS/attribute injection).
