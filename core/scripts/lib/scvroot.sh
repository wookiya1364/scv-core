#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scvroot.sh — locate the scv/ directory for the CURRENT context, so SCV works
# in a monorepo that holds MULTIPLE scv/ dirs: a micro scv per sub-project
# (FE/scv, BE/scv, AI/scv) plus a macro umbrella scv at the repo root (root/scv).
#
# Design intent (per the multi-scv model):
#   - Which scv/ a command operates on is CONTEXT-driven, not a single global
#     setting. Run a command from FE/ → FE/scv (micro); from the repo root →
#     root/scv (macro). That falls out of CWD-based resolution for free.
#   - An explicit module target arg (e.g. `action:status FE`) overrides CWD when
#     you want to address a sibling module without cd-ing.
#   - SCV_DIR (env) is only a quiet last-resort escape hatch — NOT the primary
#     mechanism (it would pin every command to one scv and break micro/macro).
#
# Public API (sourced; no side effects on source):
#
#   scv_target_path <arg>
#     Echo the scv/ path an explicit module arg resolves to, or return 1.
#       "FE"      → FE/scv   (if FE/scv exists)
#       "FE/scv"  → FE/scv   (a path whose basename is scv and which exists)
#     Callers use this to peel an optional leading module target off "$@".
#
#   scv_root_dir
#     Echo the auto-resolved scv/ dir (no explicit target). Precedence:
#       1. CWD:      ./scv exists (micro when in a module dir, macro at root).
#       2. Walk up:  nearest ancestor with a marked scv/ (session in a subdir).
#       3. SCV_DIR:  env override to an existing non-default dir (fallback).
#       4. Default:  "scv" (relative) — legacy standalone behavior, unchanged.
#     Steps 1 & 4 return the RELATIVE string "scv" so standalone repos behave
#     exactly as before.
#
#   scv_autosync [scv_dir]
#     Refresh the project's workflow docs when the stamped template version is
#     behind the payload's. Detailed contract at the function below.
#
#   scv_init_paths [target]
#     Runs scv_autosync on the resolved root, then derives
#     RAW_DIR / STATE_FILE / PROMOTE_DIR / ARCHIVE_DIR and exports SCV_DIR
#     from (target ? scv_target_path : scv_root_dir) — but only for vars the
#     caller hasn't already set, so an explicit `RAW_DIR=... bash readpath.sh`
#     still wins (env-override convention).

# ---- automatic template refresh ---------------------------------------------
# scv_autosync [scv_dir]
#   Close the gap between the project's stamped template version and the
#   payload's, the moment any action touches the project.
#
#   Why here and not in the update action: plugin payloads are cached per
#   version, so at update time the running session still holds the OLD
#   payload's sync — calling it there would lay down the old template and
#   report success. Only after a reload does any code see the new payload, and
#   the first action that runs is the first honest chance to migrate. This
#   hook is that chance.
#
#   It never hydrates (no SCV.md and no PROMOTE.md → not adopted → no-op), and
#   it never auto-migrates a pre-2.x project: the 2.0.0 retirement pass deletes
#   seven user-authored docs, and the sync protocol requires offering a
#   DECISIONS.md hand-off first — a conversation this hook must not skip. Those
#   projects get one pointer line instead. 2.x → 2.y is refreshed in place;
#   sync's dirty-refusal keeps local edits safe, and sync re-stamps the index
#   when done, so one run converges and the next call is a no-op.
#
#   A failed refresh warns and returns 0 — a migration problem must never
#   brick the action that tripped it. Opt out with SCV_AUTOSYNC=off (process
#   environment only, same reasoning as SCV_GUARD). All reporting goes to
#   stderr: callers parse this library's users' stdout.
