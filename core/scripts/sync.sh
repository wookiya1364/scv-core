# Sync SCV template into an existing project, honoring frontmatter merge_policy.

# Template layout (SCV owns only scv/; root is user-owned and never touched):
#   template/scv/SCV.md             → project scv/SCV.md   (merge-on-markers)
#   template/scv/*.md                  → project scv/*.md

# Rules:
#   - overwrite          Replace file wholesale
#   - preserve           Never change (unless --force <rel_path>)
#   - merge-on-markers   Replace file, but restore PROJECT:LOCAL block from local
#
# SCV.md is always merge-on-markers (its spec is baked into this script).

Usage: sync.sh [--project-dir PATH] [--dry-run] [--force FILE ...]

Syncs the current team standard template into an existing project.
Respects frontmatter merge_policy on each template file.

Options:
  --project-dir PATH   Target project directory (default: cwd).
  --dry-run            Print planned actions without modifying files.
  --force FILE         Force-overwrite a file whose merge_policy is 'preserve'.
                       Use the relative path under the project.
                       May be passed multiple times.

Workspace join (multi-repo):
  --join ROOT_URL      Make this repo a CHILD of the workspace whose umbrella
                       scv repo is ROOT_URL (a git URL or local path). Stamps
                       the SCV:WORKSPACE block in scv/SCV.md and exits — no
                       template merge. Re-runnable; clearing it detaches.
  --id ID              Workspace-global repo id (default: project dir basename).
  --role ROLE          Repo role (e.g. frontend, backend, ai-agent).
  --workspace NAME     Workspace name (optional, for cache namespacing).

# No backups. This script used to copy every file it changed into
# .scv-backup/<timestamp>/ — an untracked snapshot directory that its own
# retired-docs pass below already contradicted ("git history is the recovery
# path"). One file held two answers to "how do I get the old content back",
# and the copies were gitignored, so they piled up invisibly.
#
# The honest rule replaces it: a file git can restore may be replaced, and a
# file git cannot restore is refused by name. Tracked-and-modified, staged,
# untracked, and gitignored all refuse — so does every differing file in a
# project that is not a git work tree, because there the old content would
# have nowhere to survive. `--force <file>` overrides, same as for preserve.
#
# One deliberate exception: the retired-docs pass below deletes its seven
# files unconditionally. That is a recorded user decision, and it is not a
# hole this rule forgot — the sync protocol requires the interactive
# migration to offer moving their content into DECISIONS.md BEFORE this
# script runs, and the automatic refresh never reaches a pre-2.x project at
# all. The version gate on that pass is what keeps the exception narrow.

# is_dirty asks one question: can git give back the bytes this script is about

# file git never stored, and `update-index --assume-unchanged` reports clean
# while the local content exists only on disk. Content against HEAD has no
# such blind spots: untracked, ignored, and assume-unchanged all simply fail
# to match, and land on the refuse side.
#
# The comparison neutralizes the STANDARD:VERSION / SYNCED_AT stamp spans,
